VII - FELONS

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:38.894
(BIRD CHIRPING)

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:43.828
- HUGO: You're awake!

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:45.356
He saved you.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.185
He said he'll bring us to the island.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.367
He knows where it is
and he said it's called La Cuna.

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.070
- AMICIA: Wait...

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.046
- HUGO: He will find a boat too.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.680
- AMICIA: What?

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:56.703
No...

00:00:57.715 --> 00:00:58.915
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:23.593
...And in our house we had a dog.
But I didn't see him a lot.

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.140
- ARNAUD: Because you couldn't get out.

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:26.828
- HUGO: Yes.

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:29.463
So I imagined I was play with him.

00:01:31.047 --> 00:01:32.093
- ARNAUD: (SCOFFS)

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.766
I see.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.570
- HUGO: So we're here.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.579
Where's the boat?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.500
Where is it?

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:45.937
I hope it's big!

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:48.797
- ARNAUD: It's not far.
I'll free the horses.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.250
We'll take a safe route
walking for the last path.

00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:52.753
- HUGO: Sea gulls! (CHUCKLES)

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:01.922
- ARNAUD: Just a quick check.

00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:02.828
May I?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.680
It's been two days, so...

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:11.485
Good.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.150
You're fixed.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.266
Sort of.

00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:17.462
Just let it breathe from now on.

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:22.000
- AMICIA: (GROANS)

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.015
- ARNAUD: It's going to hurt
from time to time.

00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.843
Just breathe, and relax.

00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:30.439
- AMICIA: Your voice doesn't help.

00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:33.487
- ARNAUD: Stop trying to be so tough.

00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:35.312
You might learn something.

00:02:37.453 --> 00:02:38.653
- AMICIA: Fine.

00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:40.996
So tell me why you came back?

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.317
Why you didn't just let me die?

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:46.484
Tell me why should I trust you?

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:51.672
Why shouldn't I let the rats
make one less problem of <i>you</i>?

00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:59.757
- ARNAUD: The Count's Army is at war with us.

00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:02.343
<i>The Scum of Provence</i>.

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:05.954
Most of my men...

00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.071
My friends...

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.805
...have been killed...

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.356
...or ran away.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.260
It's just a matter of time
before they get me.

00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:19.778
- AMICIA: So you're running away.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.169
- ARNAUD: Yes.

00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:23.909
The ... is ... already
but you have something I don't.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.450
- AMICIA: Rats.

00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:30.865
- ARNAUD: The safest way out
of this mess for the most wanted man.

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:35.695
I know where your island is.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.300
All you must do...

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.890
...is keep me alive... until we get there.

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:44.490
- HUGO: Amicia, come!
Come and see!

00:03:46.516 --> 00:03:48.196
- AMICIA: I'm coming!

00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:52.281
Be... very... careful!

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.610
This...

00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:57.086
...is a constant remider
that I should kill you.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.196
So, what have you found?

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:12.703
- HUGO: You don't smell it?

00:04:12.453 --> 00:04:14.520
- AMICIA: I smell horses and...

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.543
Urgh... Oh... Lord, is it me?

00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:17.718
- HUGO: (CHUCKLES) No.

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:19.446
It smells like seaweed.

00:04:19.672 --> 00:04:20.672
Come on.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.743
- AMICIA: Wait, we need to talk.

00:04:22.453 --> 00:04:25.015
- HUGO: Not now! The sea is right there.

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:27.297
- AMICIA: Hugo! It's important!

00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:50.633
- HUGO: Come on, Amicia!

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.489
I've got something to show you.

00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.016 line:20%
Yahhh...

00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.071
- AMICIA: Huh... Hugo!

00:04:58.922 --> 00:05:01.189 line:20%
- HUGO: Give me all your money!

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:04.267
- AMICIA: I hope you didn't tell him
about the dream and anything else.

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:03.916 line:20%
- HUGO: You'll never catch me alive!

00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:07.484
- AMICIA: Hugo, come back!
I don't want to play!

00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:09.963 line:20%
- HUGO: And I don't talk to chicken!

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:13.265
- AMICIA: Is it that hard for you
to be nice you little...

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:15.606
Well... At least he looks better.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.316
- HUGO: Amicia, we're here!

00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:42.454
- AMICIA: Hugo, you didn't answer!

00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.250
- ARNAUD: Let's go.
We're not here to enjoy the view.

00:05:51.063 --> 00:05:52.609
- AMICIA: Tell me where we're going first.

00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:54.625
- ARNAUD: To get your boat.
I know someone.

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.808
- AMICIA: Who?

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:58.656
- ARNAUD: A smuggler.
Discreet ship. Fast. What you need.

00:05:58.703 --> 00:06:00.637
- AMICIA: Great. More felons!

00:06:00.688 --> 00:06:02.754
- ARNAUD: Yes, get used to it.

00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:04.461
This is your life now.

00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:07.265
So if you want to get to La Cuna
after the mess you've made...

00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:09.984
It's that boat or ten miles fucking swim.

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:12.484
- HUGO: I can't wait to get on a boat!

00:06:12.594 --> 00:06:14.359
- ARNAUD: Huh... You see that?

00:06:14.422 --> 00:06:16.222
<i>That</i> is the right attitude.

00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:19.890
- AMICIA: (MIMIC ARNAUD VOICE)
<i>"That is the right attitude."</i>

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.367 position:20% line:50%
- HUGO: Ah... It's too high.

00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:28.797 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Jump.
I'll catch you.

00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:29.868 line:20%
- HUGO: Whoo!

00:06:29.453 --> 00:06:31.133
- AMICIA: Hey! Careful!

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.940 line:20%
- HUGO: Thank you!

00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:32.403
- AMICIA: Fine!

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:38.180
(WIND HOWLING)

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.930
Can't you wait for me?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.484
- ARNAUD: You're not light.
Your sister feeds you well.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.180
- HUGO: I love eating.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.672
Hey! Look down there!

00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:32.001
- AMICIA: Stop going so damn fast!

00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:33.687
- ARNAUD: He's the one sprinting.

00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:36.265
Slow down, shorty.
We have <i>wounded</i>.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.093
- AMICIA: How considerate!

00:07:41.688 --> 00:07:44.140
- HUGO: Wow...
There're so many!

00:07:44.328 --> 00:07:46.484
Is it... a bird army?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.040
- ARNAUD: Looks like it.

00:07:47.828 --> 00:07:50.362
And I say
you should sound the charge.

00:07:50.188 --> 00:07:51.868
- HUGO: Can I? Amicia?

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:54.343
- AMICIA: If you want,
just stay in view.

00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:56.853
- ARNAUD: Come on, soldier. Charge!

00:07:56.438 --> 00:07:58.118
- HUGO: Charge!!!!!!!!!!

00:07:58.438 --> 00:07:59.958
- ARNAUD: (LAUGHS)

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.343
- HUGO: (LAUGHS)

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:06.774
- ARNAUD: If we had more like him in our ranks,
we would've pushed back the English a long time ago.

00:08:06.547 --> 00:08:08.218
- AMICIA: What do you know of war?

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:10.250
- ARNAUD: I was a knight back then, in Guyenne.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.481
- AMICIA: Oh...

00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:13.640
We-we're from Guyenne.

00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:15.077
- ARNAUD: It was a waste.

00:08:14.578 --> 00:08:15.938
- AMICIA: It was.

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:23.802
- HUGO: Hey, did you see my charge?

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:26.390
- AMICIA: Yes, they won't come back soon.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.730
- HUGO: I could be a soldier.

00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:29.395
- ARNAUD: (CHUCKLES) No doubt.

00:08:29.094 --> 00:08:30.703
- AMICIA: Oh, I don't think so.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:33.031
- ARNAUD: One day
he'll be big enough to choose.

00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:34.465
- AMICIA: (SCOFFS) We'll see.

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:37.305
- ARNAUD: Here we are.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.000
- AMICIA: Don't tell me <i>that's</i> your boat.

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:41.312
- ARNAUD: Of course not.
But it leads to it.

00:08:41.094 --> 00:08:43.494
See that pole?
There's a rope on it.

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:46.578
Pull the boat from there
while I push on my side.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.703
You think you can do it?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.593
- AMICIA: Not sure...
I might break.

00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:51.815
- ARNAUD: (SCOFFS)
When you're ready.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.360
- HUGO: I'll help you, Amicia.

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:56.686
- ARNAUD: Good.

00:08:56.563 --> 00:08:57.563
Keep going.

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.823
- HUGO: Arnaud!

00:08:58.703 --> 00:08:59.983
- ARNAUD: What?

00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:00.595
- HUGO: Get back!

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:01.899
- ARNAUD: What the hell?

00:09:02.328 --> 00:09:04.125
Oh shit! Shit!

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:07.054
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS)
They like you, it seems.

00:09:06.906 --> 00:09:09.125
- HUGO: (LAUGHS) Yes...

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.531
- ARNAUD: They almost got me!
You're sick, goddammit!

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.922
- AMICIA: Oh, come on!
Fine! Let's clear the way.

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:16.082
- HUGO: I could make them move.

00:09:17.688 --> 00:09:19.515
- AMICIA: Last time it didn't end well.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:21.906
- HUGO: It's not the same. I can do it.

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:23.628
- AMICIA: Yes... Let's try.

00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:30.278
- HUGO: (GRUNTS)

00:09:30.297 --> 00:09:32.097
- AMICIA: Go easy, alright?

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:32.655
- HUGO: Yes.

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.890
- ARNAUD: Alright... They're...

00:09:35.578 --> 00:09:37.378
They're really obeying you.

00:09:37.969 --> 00:09:39.765
How do you do that?

00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:41.134
- HUGO: Done!

00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.422
- AMICIA: Let's go then.

00:09:42.219 --> 00:09:44.609
- ARNAUD: They won't...
follow us, right?

00:09:44.219 --> 00:09:46.640
- AMICIA: I don't know.
How appetising do you feel?

00:09:46.703 --> 00:09:49.037
- ARNAUD: Hmmm...
Hungry bastards.

00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:51.187
Erm... No offence, shorty.

00:09:51.078 --> 00:09:53.140
- AMICIA: So this leads
to your smugglers?

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.718
- ARNAUD: Yes, it's a shortcut.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:57.156
- AMICIA: There're rats in your shortcut,
you know that?

00:09:56.813 --> 00:09:58.359
- ARNAUD: Er... Erm... Yes...

00:09:58.141 --> 00:09:59.874
Which means less soldiers.

00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:01.472
And... we have the boy, no?

00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:03.697
- AMICIA: Lord...
I don't like this.

00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:09.671
- HUGO: Uh oh...

00:10:09.344 --> 00:10:10.624
- ARNAUD: What?

00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:11.422
There're millions!

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:13.390
- AMICIA: Happy now?
We're crossing anyway.

00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:14.454
- ARNAUD: Great.

00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:15.415
- HUGO: Don't be scared!

00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:16.143
- ARNAUD: Really?

00:10:16.188 --> 00:10:19.547
Hey shorty, they're obey you.
Just send them all into the sea.

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:22.093
- HUGO: I can only control
a few at a time.

00:10:21.797 --> 00:10:23.397
- ARNAUD: Oh great!

00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:27.562
Hey! What's that stuff?

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:29.562
You used it against my men.

00:10:29.406 --> 00:10:30.846
- AMICIA: Alchemy.

00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:31.526
Secret recipe.

00:10:31.563 --> 00:10:34.437
- ARNAUD: I-I don't want a recipe
I just hope it hold.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.540
- AMICIA: You'll see.

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:53.094
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:11:14.469 --> 00:11:15.469
Up. Quick!

00:11:15.969 --> 00:11:17.009
- HUGO: Sure.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.880
- AMICIA: Climb up.

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.561
- HUGO: Alright.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.375
- ARNAUD: Alright, look!
The caves keep going on over there.

00:11:29.203 --> 00:11:30.483
That's our path.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.422
- AMICIA: So that's the <i>"shortcut"</i> to you?

00:11:32.156 --> 00:11:35.984
- ARNAUD: Yes, well... with those rats,
I'd say we go back out.

00:11:35.406 --> 00:11:37.540
- AMICIA: No! I'll lead the way.

00:11:37.328 --> 00:11:39.008
You follow, and obey.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.617
- ARNAUD: As long as
we make it out alive.

00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:44.734
- AMICIA: This will help.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.050
- ARNAUD: That tiny stick?

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:47.399
- AMICIA: Just...
(SCOFFS) follow.

00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:57.078
Stay close to me.
We're going.

00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:58.875
- ARNAUD: I'm trusting you here.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.984
- AMICIA: Hey, don't squeeze.
It won't make me go any faster.

00:12:00.712 --> 00:12:02.072
(GROUND RUMBLING)

00:12:01.712 --> 00:12:04.759
- ARNAUD: Sorry... Pretty hard
to relax right now.

00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.540
- HUGO: We've done this a lot.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.360
- ARNAUD: Well, I don't envy you.

00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:13.398
- AMICIA: Here we are. Easy!

00:12:13.438 --> 00:12:16.078
- ARNAUD: That's the word
I was searching for.

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.437
- HUGO: You really don't like rats.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.937
- ARNAUD: Nobody does, shorty.

00:12:18.094 --> 00:12:19.214
- HUGO: Wow...

00:12:18.953 --> 00:12:20.393
- AMICIA: Oh no...

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.140
- ARNAUD: What?

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.750
What is that?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.680
- AMICIA: It's a nest.

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:27.968
- ARNAUD: Well... Don't tell me
we're going in there.

00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:29.016
- AMICIA: We are.

00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:29.865
- ARNAUD: We shouldn't.

00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:31.302
- AMICIA: It's that or stay here.

00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:31.912
A cart.

00:12:31.944 --> 00:12:34.477
Your smugglers must have abandoned it.

00:12:34.256 --> 00:12:36.523
- ARNAUD: I really don't see why.

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:45.396
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:12:45.287 --> 00:12:46.818
Take a breath.
Let's go.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.334
- HUGO: It's going to be horrible, Amicia.

00:12:49.272 --> 00:12:52.072
- ARNAUD: Come on, even the boy's scared.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.530
Are you sure about this?

00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:56.162
- AMICIA: I'm sure there's no other way.

00:12:55.928 --> 00:12:58.068
The cart's likely cover us.

00:12:58.147 --> 00:13:00.413
- ARNAUD: I'm not ready for this.

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:01.506
The stench.

00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:03.651
What is that thing?

00:13:03.694 --> 00:13:05.615
Makes my skin crawled.

00:13:05.694 --> 00:13:07.374
- AMICIA: They make it.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.568
From things they catch.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.090
- HUGO: Like people.

00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:12.139
- ARNAUD: Bloody hell!

00:13:13.912 --> 00:13:16.131
You said you lived in Guyenne.

00:13:16.334 --> 00:13:18.014
It all started there...

00:13:18.053 --> 00:13:19.053
You...

00:13:18.694 --> 00:13:20.459
- HUGO: I didn't do it on purpose!

00:13:20.397 --> 00:13:22.052
- ARNAUD: You started this?

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:23.771
- AMICIA: He can't do anything about it, alright?

00:13:23.584 --> 00:13:26.287
We're stuck with those things
just like everybody else.

00:13:28.006 --> 00:13:30.396
- ARNAUD: This is the hell we all deserve.

00:13:29.928 --> 00:13:31.661
- HUGO: I want it to stop.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.006
- AMICIA: We'll get to La Cuna.
We'll cure you.

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:35.499
- ARNAUD: That's crazy.

00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:36.678
Damn...

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.420
How big is that thing?

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.780
- HUGO: Could be huge.

00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:49.220
- AMICIA: Through here, I think.
Careful.

00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:00.557
- ARNAUD: Oh shit!

00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:01.239
- HUGO: Arnaud!

00:14:00.787 --> 00:14:02.467
- AMICIA: Lord... no!

00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:04.302
- ARNAUD: They're coming for me!

00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:05.385
I need light, fast!

00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:07.472
- AMICIA: Wait, wait, I'll do it!

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.740
There.

00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:09.334
- HUGO: Yes.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.670 line:20%
- ARNAUD: God... damn!

00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:11.753 line:20%
Pieces of shit!

00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:13.646
- AMICIA: You're alright? No bite?

00:14:14.194 --> 00:14:15.521 line:20%
- ARNAUD: I'm good.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.052 line:20%
Except I'm stuck and they're looking at me
like I'm a piece of roast meat!

00:14:18.787 --> 00:14:21.254
- AMICIA: Hugo, we should leave, now.

00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:22.321
- HUGO: What? Why?

00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:24.077
- AMICIA: He's dangerous.

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:25.182
- HUGO: So are you.

00:14:25.272 --> 00:14:27.724
And... I'm even more dangerous.

00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:29.474
But we need him.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.067 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Hey!
I need you down here!

00:14:32.084 --> 00:14:34.662
- AMICIA: I... (SIGHS) Alright, fine.

00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:37.271
- HUGO: Amicia, look!
The yellow crystals!

00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:38.635
It's Episanguis.

00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:40.945
- AMICIA: You're right.
It's back!

00:14:40.803 --> 00:14:41.803
Arnaud!

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.295 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Ah... finally!

00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:45.521
- AMICIA: There're yellow crystals near you.

00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:47.581
Break one off and throw it to me.

00:14:47.397 --> 00:14:48.917 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Alright.

00:14:48.772 --> 00:14:49.772 line:20%
I'm ready.

00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:54.787 line:20%
On your go!

00:14:57.428 --> 00:14:58.868
- AMICIA: Perfect!

00:14:59.069 --> 00:15:00.749
Won't work alone now.

00:15:00.803 --> 00:15:03.070
I need to add this into something.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.318
Here, Odoris, let's try it!

00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:08.787
Arnaud, see that high ground
with the crank?

00:15:08.537 --> 00:15:11.365
When I move the rats
out of your way, you run for it.

00:15:11.131 --> 00:15:12.811 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Yes, whatever.

00:15:16.162 --> 00:15:17.282
- AMICIA: Now!

00:15:17.912 --> 00:15:19.272
- HUGO: It works!

00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:20.034 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Yes.

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:22.287 line:20%
I don't know what that was
but you saved my skin.

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:23.271
- AMICIA: We're not out yet.

00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:24.443
What's that crank for?

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:26.594
- ARNAUD: No idea. We could try it.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.832
- AMICIA: I leave it to you, Arnaud.

00:15:35.475 --> 00:15:37.075 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Let's go.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.450 line:20%
Looks like something
you could use, no?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.693 line:20%
With your...
crossbow magic.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.420
- AMICIA: Let me see.

00:15:48.678 --> 00:15:50.358
There, it should hold.

00:15:50.444 --> 00:15:52.977 line:20%
- ARNAUD: Tell me when to release it!

00:15:54.569 --> 00:15:56.249
- AMICIA: You can let go.

00:15:55.912 --> 00:15:57.592 line:20%
- ARNAUD: On my way.

00:16:00.006 --> 00:16:01.584
- HUGO: Run, Arnaud!

00:16:01.412 --> 00:16:03.212 line:20%
- ARNAUD: You bet, I will.

00:16:07.537 --> 00:16:09.137
Ha... What the hell?

00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:12.153
There's something sticky on the ground.

00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:13.349
- AMICIA: It's only blood.

00:16:13.084 --> 00:16:14.764
The remains of the prey.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.631
And something they secrete, I think.

00:16:16.444 --> 00:16:19.110
- HUGO: Don't worry,
it's not dangerous.

00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:20.146
- ARNAUD: Are you joking?

00:16:20.037 --> 00:16:21.717
I'm burning these boots.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.200
- AMICIA: Come on!
You're almost there.

00:16:25.022 --> 00:16:27.724
- ARNAUD: Bloody...
Rotten... Crap!

00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:31.115
(PANTING) I'm here.

00:16:32.928 --> 00:16:34.861
- AMICIA: Yes, feeling alive?

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:36.959
- ARNAUD: I've...
been in a hundred battles.

00:16:37.006 --> 00:16:39.806
Looked death in the eye
about as many times.

00:16:39.912 --> 00:16:41.592
But these little turds...

00:16:41.975 --> 00:16:44.349
They make me feel like a fresh recruit.

00:16:44.053 --> 00:16:45.853
- HUGO: Now you're trained!

00:16:46.647 --> 00:16:49.047
- ARNAUD: You're the patron saint of optimism.

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:50.084
So...

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:53.359
Do you have any tricks left
to keep us going?

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.922
- AMICIA: No...
I don't see anything to shoot at.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.834
And I have nothing
that would last long enough.

00:16:57.694 --> 00:16:59.506
- ARNAUD: No no,
we're getting out of here.

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:00.553
Wait.

00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:01.709
I know.

00:17:03.803 --> 00:17:06.177
Shoot one of your
flamming bolts at my shield.

00:17:06.022 --> 00:17:08.146
- AMICIA: What? But it will burn.

00:17:07.772 --> 00:17:10.052
- ARNAUD: (CHUCKLES)
Does it look like it cares?

00:17:09.897 --> 00:17:12.030
- AMICIA: Alright... I'll do it.

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.442
- ARNAUD: Ah...

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:20.052
I felt that... Good.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.560
When you're ready.
Quick, please!

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.120
- AMICIA: Let's go.

00:17:24.162 --> 00:17:27.177
- ARNAUD: Oh... we're doing this.
Mark my words.

00:17:26.694 --> 00:17:27.894
Out of the way!

00:17:27.928 --> 00:17:29.677
- HUGO: Yes! Shoo!

00:17:29.897 --> 00:17:33.673
- ARNAUD: Look at the cowards
crawling back to their holes!

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.349
Ha... That's it!

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.177
Fall back before the might of <i>The Wall</i>.

00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:41.904
- AMICIA: See? You're getting used to them.

00:17:41.022 --> 00:17:42.702
- HUGO: (LAUGHS) Yes.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.474
They're scared of you now.

00:17:44.756 --> 00:17:46.436
- ARNAUD: Bloody hell.

00:17:46.475 --> 00:17:48.808
My arm feels like it's aflame, no?

00:17:49.006 --> 00:17:50.873
- HUGO: But you're <i>The Wall</i>.

00:17:50.928 --> 00:17:54.448
- ARNAUD: And this wall
has taken enough blows, shorty!

00:17:54.037 --> 00:17:56.371
My body is as battled as my shield.

00:17:56.569 --> 00:17:57.787
- HUGO: Ewww...

00:17:57.944 --> 00:17:59.944
- ARNAUD: That's war for you.

00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:06.662
- AMICIA: We're nearly there.
Hold on a bit longer.

00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:09.048
- ARNAUD: Oh, I'll hold.
It's what I do.

00:18:22.709 --> 00:18:23.989
Alright, enough.

00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:26.709
- AMICIA: Did you get burnt?

00:18:26.334 --> 00:18:28.037
- ARNAUD: I wouldn't say that.

00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:29.131
Just a good sweat.

00:18:29.178 --> 00:18:30.538
Let's keep going.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.795
- AMICIA: Jump down, go!

00:18:36.709 --> 00:18:37.989
- HUGO: Will do.

00:18:50.115 --> 00:18:51.115
Oh...

00:18:51.209 --> 00:18:52.809
Is it the big wreck?

00:18:52.584 --> 00:18:54.959
- ARNAUD: It is.
We're almost there.

00:18:54.678 --> 00:18:57.240
Her hideout is on the other side
of that boat.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:57.849
- AMICIA: <i>"Her."</i>

00:18:57.365 --> 00:18:59.165
- ARNAUD: Yes... Sophia...

00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:00.585
<i>The Sea Scorpion</i>.

00:19:00.647 --> 00:19:02.007
She's the leader.

00:19:01.631 --> 00:19:03.474
- HUGO: She sounds scary.

00:19:03.522 --> 00:19:05.709
- ARNAUD: Less scary than those damn biters.

00:19:05.537 --> 00:19:08.912
- AMICIA: We'll see when we meet her.
Come on. One last effort.

00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:29.485
So, these smugglers,
how many are there?

00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:30.459
- ARNAUD: A bunch.

00:19:30.287 --> 00:19:33.474
Scums she gathered
from all around the Mediterranean Sea.

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.981
Sophia is their lighthouse in the dark.

00:19:35.897 --> 00:19:37.097
They see her as a saint.

00:19:37.178 --> 00:19:39.045
- AMICIA: Is she... a saint?

00:19:38.709 --> 00:19:40.069
- ARNAUD: Oh no.

00:19:48.377 --> 00:19:50.551 line:20%
(DISTANT CHATTER)

00:20:02.625 --> 00:20:05.945

00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:08.028 line:20%
- SOLDIER 1: Hey! You found any tracks?

00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:09.571
- AMICIA: Shh...

00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:12.667 line:20%
- SOLDIER 2: Nothing. You sure
there're still people here with those rats?

00:20:12.517 --> 00:20:14.037
- ARNAUD: Stay low.

00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:14.909
- HUGO: Soldiers.

00:20:14.727 --> 00:20:17.917 line:20%
- SOLDIER 2: Look around ya.
This place is a bloody maze!

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.236 line:20%
Listen, if we bring back ... smugglers,
the Count will decorate us.

00:20:22.532 --> 00:20:25.432
- ARNAUD: Yes, soldiers.
I'll get rid of them.

00:20:25.246 --> 00:20:26.809
- AMICIA: No, I'll do it.

00:20:26.532 --> 00:20:28.190
- ARNAUD: Still pretty sharp.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.722
- AMICIA: Thanks.

00:20:28.302 --> 00:20:29.992
- ARNAUD: You could do better though.

00:20:29.421 --> 00:20:30.861

00:21:53.147 --> 00:21:54.827
- AMICIA: Come along. Up.

00:21:54.623 --> 00:21:56.063
- HUGO: On my way.

00:21:57.643 --> 00:21:59.323 line:20%
- SOLDIER: What's that?

00:22:02.224 --> 00:22:05.620
- AMICIA: We're on the other side
of the wreck, so where now?

00:22:04.303 --> 00:22:08.367 line:20%
- SOLDIER: (SCREAMING)

00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:07.303
- ARNAUD: That torch.
Down there, by the wreck.

00:22:07.097 --> 00:22:08.097
It's there.

00:22:07.986 --> 00:22:09.186
- AMICIA: Good.

00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:10.346
- ARNAUD: I hope Sophia is still there.

00:22:09.918 --> 00:22:11.775
- AMICIA: What? Why wouldn't she be?

00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:14.409
- ARNAUD: Oh, she's pretty... unpredictable.

00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:16.086
- AMICIA: No no no.
She has to be.

00:22:32.453 --> 00:22:33.653
Get down there.

00:22:33.548 --> 00:22:34.748
- HUGO: Got it.

00:22:34.215 --> 00:22:35.948
- AMICIA: Yes. We're here.

00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:37.498
- HUGO: I'm scared she's a scorpion.

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:39.922
- AMICIA: No, come on.
I'll be fine.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.280
Through here?

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.190
- ARNAUD: Yes.

00:22:42.772 --> 00:22:45.105
A discreet way for discreet people.

00:22:55.194 --> 00:22:56.474
- AMICIA: Water.

00:22:56.381 --> 00:22:59.181
- ARNAUD: The hideout is just at the end.

00:22:58.678 --> 00:23:00.038
- HUGO: No... No!

00:23:00.584 --> 00:23:02.264
I'm scared of the waves.

00:23:02.522 --> 00:23:03.849
- AMICIA: Oh come on!

00:23:03.647 --> 00:23:05.380
It's just sea water, look!

00:23:05.506 --> 00:23:06.912
- ARNAUD: She's right.

00:23:06.506 --> 00:23:07.802
- HUGO: But... it's deep!

00:23:07.225 --> 00:23:08.905
- AMICIA: Hugo, please.

00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:09.928
I'm tired.

00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:11.506
Just...

00:23:11.397 --> 00:23:12.900
Think of your island.

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:14.642
- HUGO: But there are waves.

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.877
- ARNAUD: We're almost there.

00:23:15.752 --> 00:23:17.432
Can't you argue later?

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.014
- AMICIA: Don't you start to.

00:23:18.752 --> 00:23:19.846
I'll take your hand...

00:23:19.112 --> 00:23:20.632
- HUGO: It's bad...

00:23:19.362 --> 00:23:22.877
- ARNAUD: Enough. I'll carry you
all the way and that's it.

00:23:22.643 --> 00:23:23.923
- HUGO: Alright.

00:23:23.627 --> 00:23:24.907
- ARNAUD: Good.

00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:26.652
There you go.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.190
- AMICIA: Lord...

00:23:29.627 --> 00:23:31.814
- ARNAUD: Is that high enough for you?

00:23:31.518 --> 00:23:34.439
(CHUCKLES) Look...
You're not even touching the water.

00:23:34.643 --> 00:23:35.643
- HUGO: Yes.

00:23:36.096 --> 00:23:39.486
- ARNAUD: Well... Everyday can't be easy
when you're that small.

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:41.451
- AMICIA: Depends on the day.

00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:43.901
- ARNAUD: Are you still scared?

00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:44.643
- HUGO: No.

00:23:44.862 --> 00:23:47.689
- ARNAUD: (CHUCKLES) Now you know
why they call me <i>The Wall</i>.

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:49.492
- HUGO: Because you're like a fort?

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:50.929
- ARNAUD: Exactly.

00:23:50.705 --> 00:23:52.385
Nothing gets past me.

00:23:52.409 --> 00:23:54.986
- HUGO: And your shield looks like a wall too.

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:56.611
- ARNAUD: How's it going back there?

00:23:56.362 --> 00:23:59.562
- AMICIA: It's all fine.
Now that he's calmed down.

00:24:08.143 --> 00:24:09.143
Well...

00:24:09.612 --> 00:24:11.132
Thank you, Arnaud.

00:24:10.768 --> 00:24:12.736
- HUGO: Yes. Thank you!

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:15.517
- ARNAUD: Time to meet the <i>Sea Scorpion</i>.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.814
I know you like to lead...

00:24:40.737 --> 00:24:42.417
But I better pass first.

00:24:43.096 --> 00:24:45.096
- AMICIA: Well...
Be my guest.

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:03.799
- ARNAUD: It's me, goddammit.

00:25:04.143 --> 00:25:05.823
- SOPHIA: Let him pass.

00:25:15.174 --> 00:25:16.174
Arnaud.

00:25:18.034 --> 00:25:20.767
Even those rot-eating rats didn't want you.

00:25:21.455 --> 00:25:23.135
- ARNAUD: I've got help.

00:25:25.377 --> 00:25:27.057
- SOPHIA: Look at that.

00:25:29.377 --> 00:25:30.977
I like the new crew.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.533
- ARNAUD: This is Amicia and Hugo.

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:35.979
The one has potential.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.300
The big sister...

00:25:38.908 --> 00:25:40.708
...still needs to be tamed.

00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:42.475
- AMICIA: Try that.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:44.194
- ARNAUD: You see?

00:25:44.002 --> 00:25:47.202
- SOPHIA: I see you left your mark on her already.

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:49.064
Don't be ashamed, sweetheart.

00:25:48.862 --> 00:25:49.902
It suits you.

00:25:51.034 --> 00:25:52.394
What do you want?

00:25:52.268 --> 00:25:56.611
- ARNAUD: Your boat. We need to go
to La Cuna. No questions asked.

00:25:57.471 --> 00:25:59.471
- SOPHIA: We're done, Arnaud.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.464
The Count's Army is on our back.

00:26:01.784 --> 00:26:02.784
And...

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.252
Thousands of rats
are shitting on my doorstep.

00:26:05.284 --> 00:26:06.804
This place is over.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.510
I'm disbanding the crew.

00:26:08.096 --> 00:26:09.536
- ARNAUD: Then...

00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:10.409
Come along.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.533
Sophia, you owe me.

00:26:14.502 --> 00:26:16.182
- SOPHIA: Alright then.

00:26:17.112 --> 00:26:19.658
<i>The Call of The Sea</i> it is.

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:21.839
I need some time off.

00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:22.768
Who cares.

00:26:27.862 --> 00:26:29.302
One thing, though.

00:26:29.018 --> 00:26:30.378
- ARNAUD: Go on.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:33.743
- SOPHIA: If you ever hurt her
in front of me...

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:34.419
I'll kill you.

00:26:34.471 --> 00:26:36.204
- ARNAUD: (LONG CHUCKLES)

00:26:37.112 --> 00:26:38.674
Deal.

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:43.839
- SOPHIA: By the way...

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:46.892
The Count's men
put my boat in dry dock.

00:26:47.018 --> 00:26:49.685
- ARNAUD: Oh, <i>The Call of The Sea</i>, huh?

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:51.307
- SOPHIA: That part's also true.

00:26:51.893 --> 00:26:53.693
I need a word with my crew.

00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:56.955
Go ahead to the village.
My boat is there. I'll join you.

00:26:57.034 --> 00:26:58.314
- ARNAUD: Sure.

00:26:58.237 --> 00:26:59.439
Let's go.

00:26:59.925 --> 00:27:03.737
- MAN 1: So... Is this time of year
when you quit everything?

00:27:04.643 --> 00:27:07.543
- SOPHIA: I'm afraid
it's for good this time.

00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:11.940
- MAN 2: Sure. We'll play jacks
and wait for you to come back.

00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:13.377
As always.

00:27:14.862 --> 00:27:16.592

It's raining a lot.

00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:29.945
- ARNAUD: Yes. Must be a heat storm.
You see the light?

00:27:30.425 --> 00:27:34.049
It's the lighthouse from the fishermen's village.
Sophia's boat is there.

00:27:33.893 --> 00:27:36.768

in this weather?

There's another one coming.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.033
- ARNAUD: So what?
I'll take care of him.

00:27:52.815 --> 00:27:54.080
Say the word.

00:27:54.112 --> 00:27:55.792
Command and I'll execute.

Arnaud, go after this one!

before we get to that boat.

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:24.904
Amicia, can we go see
even without Sophia?

00:37:26.061 --> 00:37:27.994
- AMICIA: I don't know, Hugo.

00:37:29.061 --> 00:37:31.498
- ARNAUD: I can take him.
Get some rest.

00:37:31.342 --> 00:37:33.675
It'll be fine.
We'll be just there.

00:37:36.248 --> 00:37:38.779
- AMICIA: Set the rats on him
if he's not nice.

00:37:38.279 --> 00:37:39.279
- HUGO: Yes.

00:37:39.514 --> 00:37:42.888
- ARNAUD: Don't be so happy
when she says things like that.

You got nowhere to run!

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.984
And the Count doesn't need you alive!

- AMICIA: Are you alright?

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:27.944
- SOPHIA: No.

00:38:29.311 --> 00:38:30.431
We just met...

00:38:30.717 --> 00:38:32.397
And I already owe you.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.320
- AMICIA: You don't owe me anything.

00:38:35.404 --> 00:38:37.738
- SOPHIA: You don't make the rules.

00:38:37.842 --> 00:38:40.850
- AMICIA: Fine.
We can be friends if that helps.

00:38:41.076 --> 00:38:42.676
- SOPHIA: Let's try.

00:38:43.295 --> 00:38:46.195
But... You'll end up wanting to kill me too.

00:38:58.326 --> 00:39:00.006
Caught your breath yet?

00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:01.139
Ready to go?

00:39:09.436 --> 00:39:12.236
- AMICIA: So... that's the Rascasse, right?

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.720
- SOPHIA: The one and only.

00:39:13.467 --> 00:39:15.267
I hope they didn't ruin it.

00:39:16.686 --> 00:39:18.685
- AMICIA: Arnaud, where's Hugo?

00:39:18.326 --> 00:39:19.686
- HUGO: I'm here.

00:39:19.498 --> 00:39:21.248
It's amazing!

00:39:21.498 --> 00:39:25.404
- AMICIA: What're you doing outside?
Get in the cabin, you're soaked.

00:39:25.186 --> 00:39:27.873
- HUGO: Yes! To the cabin!

00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:30.966
- ARNAUD: So, how do we get this thing
into the water?

00:39:30.686 --> 00:39:34.091
- SOPHIA: Go and lift the anchor with Amicia
while I check the route to La Cuna.

00:39:33.779 --> 00:39:35.459
It's the crank at the prow.

00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:37.115
- ARNAUD: Leave this to me.

00:39:36.342 --> 00:39:37.462

(THUNDERING NOISE)

00:39:49.311 --> 00:39:50.511
It's not light.

00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:54.505
- ARNAUD: It's an anchor.
It's made to anchor.

00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:57.498
- AMICIA: It's stuck.

00:39:57.404 --> 00:40:00.216
- ARNAUD: Sophia, I think
they've blocked the anchor.

00:40:00.061 --> 00:40:01.927
- SOPHIA: (SCOFFS)
Bastards.

00:40:01.967 --> 00:40:06.310
Go to that pontoon with the crank.
It controls the chain.

00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:10.466
- ARNAUD: Bloody rats.
Can you do something about them?

00:40:10.139 --> 00:40:11.739
- AMICIA: I'll look.

00:40:32.959 --> 00:40:33.999
Food's ready.

00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:36.881
- ARNAUD: Good shot!

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.030
- AMICIA: Safe to go.

00:40:41.936 --> 00:40:44.357
- AMICIA: Sophia doesn't seem
to like you much.

00:40:43.779 --> 00:40:45.795
- ARNAUD: It changes with the wind.

00:40:45.529 --> 00:40:47.279
But she owes me either way.

00:40:47.076 --> 00:40:48.123
- AMICIA: What for?

00:40:47.733 --> 00:40:50.326
- ARNAUD: For not killing her
when I was ordered to.

00:40:49.936 --> 00:40:51.216
- AMICIA: I see.

00:41:01.561 --> 00:41:04.461

is blocking the anchor.

I need a hand.

00:41:15.514 --> 00:41:17.194
- ARNAUD: That's my job.

00:41:16.951 --> 00:41:20.407
We're almost there.
Your brother will soon see La Cuna.

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.991
- AMICIA: I hope he will.

00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:28.427

00:41:27.545 --> 00:41:28.665
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:41:44.279 --> 00:41:45.685
- ARNAUD: Good shot.

00:41:45.342 --> 00:41:47.654
- AMICIA: Let's pull this anchor up
and set sail.

00:41:48.826 --> 00:41:51.160
He likes you,
so you should know...

00:41:51.733 --> 00:41:52.773
Hugo's dying.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:53.388
- ARNAUD: What?

00:41:53.154 --> 00:41:55.013
- AMICIA: His blood is poisoned.

00:41:54.748 --> 00:41:57.029
If there's a remedy,
it's on that island.

00:41:56.842 --> 00:41:58.732
- ARNAUD: Then let's make sure
he gets there.

00:41:58.279 --> 00:42:00.138
- AMICIA: Oh, he will.

00:42:02.545 --> 00:42:04.612

are we leaving?

00:42:05.311 --> 00:42:08.831

Go back inside the cabin.

00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:10.147
- HUGO: Yes, captain!

00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:13.462
- AMICIA: Let's finish with this anchor.

00:42:30.061 --> 00:42:32.060
- SOPHIA: Hey...
Did you do it?

00:42:32.076 --> 00:42:34.248
- AMICIA: Yes, the anchor's up.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.982
- SOPHIA: Great! Now hoy the main sails
together. On the upper deck.

00:42:37.732 --> 00:42:39.169

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.100

00:42:45.889 --> 00:42:47.689
I'll take... the other one.

Yes, we're doing it.
We're leaving this place.

00:43:03.045 --> 00:43:06.279
What? The sail
is not deploying on my side!

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:07.810

Crap!

00:43:15.857 --> 00:43:18.057
Those arseholes tied up my sail?

00:43:17.935 --> 00:43:19.638
- ARNAUD: Then let's untie it.

00:43:19.435 --> 00:43:21.482
- SOPHIA: We don't have time
to go up there.

00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:22.951
- AMICIA: I could try to cut it.

00:43:22.545 --> 00:43:24.966
- SOPHIA: Yes, get on the starboard pontoon.

00:43:24.826 --> 00:43:26.279
You'll get a better angle.

00:43:25.998 --> 00:43:27.865
Just don't damage the sail.
