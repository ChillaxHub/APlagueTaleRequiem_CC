00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:32.617
VIII - A SEA OF PROMISES

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.635
- AMICIA: (DEEP EXHALE)
The sea is so quiet.

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:56.822
Nothing but the horizon.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.891
Enjoy.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Animals.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:06.484
Maybe from... Africa?

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.559
Looks like Hugo played with them.

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:12.339
Hope he didn't break anything.

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:15.598
It was so good to sleep.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:18.844
Herbs and ...

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.281
The one she gave to Hugo worked well.

00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:23.238
I hope he's feeling better.

00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:28.827
Such a nice bed.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.019
Our captain has good taste.

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:35.728
That smell...

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:39.375
Incense... That's amazing.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.750
Hm...

00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:45.906
The Mediteranean Sea

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:48.294
La Cuna should be somewhere here.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.610
This one?

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.235
Or this one?

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:58.828
Necklaces, rings...

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:01.024
Quite the elegant lady.

00:02:12.157 --> 00:02:13.157
Hey, sailor.

00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:16.567
Anything to report?

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.970
An island, maybe?

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.030
- HUGO: Not yet.

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:21.422
But it's so beautiful!

00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:23.406
The colours keep changing.

00:02:23.454 --> 00:02:25.891
And I'm seeing huge fishes.

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:27.469
Maybe a dolphin.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:29.055
- AMICIA: That's great.

00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:37.828
So... it survived the fire?

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.437
- ARNAULD: Yes, it would take more than that.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.312
It survives Spain...

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:43.197
Burgaindee...

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.547
Guyenne...

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.297
Well... Barely at the time.

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:48.735
- AMICIA: That's where it broke?

00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:49.497
- ARNAULD: Yes.

00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:51.458
The only time it...

00:02:51.907 --> 00:02:53.587
...failed to protect.

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:54.636
- AMICIA: You?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.230
- ARNAULD: No.

00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:58.221
Someone I shared my coat of arms with.

00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.325
- AMICIA: Oh...

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500
I-I see.

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:03.783
It's a... sad memory to keep then.

00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:07.077
- ARNAULD: Some memories
don't want to be let go of, child.

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:08.484
- AMICIA: I think I know what you mean.

00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:11.406
- SOPHIA: Hey you two, the sail's pulling portside.

00:03:11.188 --> 00:03:12.308
I need a hand.

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:15.578
- ARNAULD: Go pull the rope on the other side.
I'll give you some slacks on mine.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.290
- AMICIA: Understood.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.719
Got it.

00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:27.859
I... just... love this.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.180
It's good on my side.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.829
Arnauld?

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:36.909
- ARNAULD: Me too.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:38.132
- SOPHIA: Well done!

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:58.025
- AMICIA: We can't see the continent anymore.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:58.938
Mother...

00:03:58.782 --> 00:03:59.782
Lucas...

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:01.567
I hope you're safe.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.375
Hey.

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.686
It must be great to pilot this thing.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:21.604
- SOPHIA: It's worth all the other troubles.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.470
Come on. Take it.

00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:25.337
- AMICIA: Oh... Ah...

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:27.821
- SOPHIA: Go on,
you won't crash into anything.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.860
So?

00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:44.384
- AMICIA: It's amazing!

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:49.494
- SOPHIA: It's the sea you feel.
It's freedom.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:54.116
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.105
For taking us.

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:59.057
- SOPHIA: Thank Arnauld.
I'm not usually so kind.

00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:00.494
- AMICIA: Oh.

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:03.232
- SOPHIA: He's a bastard, I know.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.450
He has reasons to be, deep scars.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:08.024
Not that I excuse it...

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:08.844
- HUGO: Amicia! Amicia!

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.691
- AMICIA: Oh... Duty calls.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.625
I'm sorry.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.805
- SOPHIA: You're welcome.

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:13.804
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.321
- HUGO: Amicia, come!

00:05:20.938 --> 00:05:23.609
Look! There's something there!

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.859
That's it! La Cuna!

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:45.578
It's exactly like in my dreams.

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:47.469
Thank you.

00:05:51.407 --> 00:05:54.172
- AMICIA: Whatever's there...
we'll find it together.

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:55.673
Island explorers.

00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:56.516
- HUGO: Yes.

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:00.875
You know...

00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:04.031
It's not important if I die.

00:06:04.204 --> 00:06:06.531
- AMICIA: What? What are you talking about?

00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:09.719
- HUGO: The Magister Vaudin told me
I'm going to die.

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:13.409
- AMICIA: God, no, Hugo. I'm so sorry.

00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:14.921
It won't happen.

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.337
- HUGO: Don't be sad.

00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:19.337
I'm happy to be here.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.047
This boat is the best and...

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:23.750
I like Sophia.

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:26.933
And Arnauld, even if you don't like him.

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:30.968
- SOPHIA: Sorry.

00:06:31.344 --> 00:06:34.992
Just wanted to say,
we'll be preparing to make land soon.

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:36.819
I'll need your help.

00:06:36.914 --> 00:06:39.448
Just... Come see me when you're ready.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.999
- AMICIA: Yes, sure.

00:06:45.047 --> 00:06:47.047
I'm happy to be here with you.

00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:04.676
Wow... She only has some
real treasures down here.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.494
She must've travelled a lot
to get all these.

00:07:12.087 --> 00:07:14.887
And now she'll probably sell them legally.

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.404
Books.

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:20.766
Pretty rare.

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:28.195
Ah yes... That's Arnauld's.

00:07:28.627 --> 00:07:31.827
Can't believe I heard him
snore through the storm.

00:07:40.023 --> 00:07:41.956
Is the island still in sight?

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.663
- HUGO: We're approaching it.

00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:45.948
Did Sophia teach you how to pilot the boat?

00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:47.280
- AMICIA: She did, indeed.

00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:50.022
Mind spending some time
with your old sister?

00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:51.540
- HUGO: (LAUGHS)

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.995
You're not... old!

00:07:54.677 --> 00:07:55.677
Say...

00:07:55.982 --> 00:07:58.649
How does Sophia know the way to La Cuna.

00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.104
- AMICIA: Tools, probably.

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:01.845
There might be some around.

00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:03.226
Or we can ask her.

00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:03.813
- HUGO: Yes!

00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:08.518
- AMICIA: Hi.

00:08:08.103 --> 00:08:09.970
- HUGO: It's a great shield.

00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:11.540
- ARNAULD: It does its job.

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.087
Saved my life ... enough.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.170
- HUGO: I like the bird on it.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:16.859
- ARNAULD: It's a ...

00:08:16.652 --> 00:08:18.332
Half ... and half eagle.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.928
So you're half right.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.770
It was my coat of arms.

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:23.942
<i>Courage and Cunning</i>, that's me.

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:25.960
- HUGO: Our coat of arms is a tree.

00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:27.567
- ARNAULD: Ah... It's a good crest too.

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:29.490
Strength, stability, wisdom.

00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:32.154
- AMICIA: That's all us.
Come on, Hugo.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.090
Down to the hole.

00:08:40.994 --> 00:08:41.994
- HUGO: Wow.

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:43.946
Is this really all hers?

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:45.899
- AMICIA: I suppose so.

00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:47.600
Unless she stole from her crew.

00:08:47.355 --> 00:08:49.155
Now this will interest you.

00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:49.985
- HUGO: Oh.

00:08:50.168 --> 00:08:51.562
What is it?

00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:53.508
- AMICIA: It's an astrolabe.

00:08:53.806 --> 00:08:57.444
Father told me once that you use it
to find your way by the stars.

00:08:57.344 --> 00:08:58.384
- HUGO: Oh...

00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:00.525
Can we try it now?

00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:02.858
- AMICIA: Maybe at night, we'll see.

00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:06.803
Hey, look! A compass.

00:09:06.752 --> 00:09:08.432
- HUGO: Can I hold it?

00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:09.754
- AMICIA: Yes, but... be careful.

00:09:09.442 --> 00:09:10.535
- HUGO: It's heavy.

00:09:10.335 --> 00:09:13.147
- AMICIA: That needle
always shows where north is.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.913
- HUGO: It moves when I move.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.942
- AMICIA: Well... Just stop moving then.

00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:19.620
- HUGO: Here... The island
is in the south. Right?

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:21.205
- AMICIA: Right where we're heading.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.611
- HUGO: Can I keep it to play?

00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:26.395
- AMICIA: Yes, but... don't break it.
Unless you want to face Sophia.

00:09:32.869 --> 00:09:33.869
Climb first.

00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:35.231
- HUGO: Alright.

00:09:39.308 --> 00:09:41.339
Hugo and Amicia on deck.

00:09:41.418 --> 00:09:43.151
- AMICIA: Yes, we're here.

00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:44.632
- SOPHIA: We know.

00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:46.663
- HUGO: Listen all, I'm captain De Rune.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.407
And I say we're going south.

00:09:48.549 --> 00:09:50.229
The compass is said so.

00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:52.312
So you all listen to the compass.

00:09:52.578 --> 00:09:55.178
- AMICIA: A great leader - The compass.
(CHUCKLES)

00:10:51.965 --> 00:10:54.587
- HUGO: Whoo hoo!
Prepare to board! (CHUCKLES)

00:10:57.578 --> 00:10:58.698
- ARNAULD: Hi.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.830
Alright people, come.

00:11:02.857 --> 00:11:04.137
- HUGO: My turn.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.942
- SOPHIA: I'll stay. I'll fix
a few things here and I'll join you later.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.531
- AMICIA: Fine. We'll take a tour when it's till light.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.198
And find a place to sleep.

00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:18.136
- SOPHIA: Sounds good.
By the way...

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:20.859
This land is under the Count's law.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:21.759
Be nice.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:23.199
See?

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:24.495
- AMICIA: I see.

00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:39.512
- WOMAN: Welcome to La Cuna.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.250
This is for you, my child.

00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:44.264
We're so honoured by your presence.

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:45.626
- HUGO: Thank you.

00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:49.910
- ARNAULD: Looks like we have a new king.

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:51.513
- HUGO: Good king Hugo.

00:11:51.886 --> 00:11:53.566
- WOMAN: That's right!

00:11:53.415 --> 00:11:55.215
During the <i>Brighter Days</i>...

00:11:55.134 --> 00:11:57.477
All children are kings.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.243
Just like the <i>Child of Embers</i>
who watches over our island.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.498
Your presence is a blessing.

00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:06.663
Because you're the future.

00:12:06.563 --> 00:12:07.846
Just like him.

00:12:07.924 --> 00:12:11.741
For heal and deliver
all of us from the darkness.

00:12:12.244 --> 00:12:15.089
Please enjoy the festivities.

Wow...

00:12:19.665 --> 00:12:21.732
That's a pretty good start, no?

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.647
- ARNAULD: No wonder what the church
would think of this.

00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:28.857
They seem successful.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.563

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:34.051
Well, come on, Your Majesty.

00:12:35.223 --> 00:12:35.971
(CHUCKLES)

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:41.709
- HUGO: We're in my dream, Amicia.

00:12:42.255 --> 00:12:45.335
It's the most beautiful place I've seen.

00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:47.546
- AMICIA: It's very beautiful, yes.

00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:50.148
But now we need to find
whatever called you here.

00:13:28.622 --> 00:13:30.355
- ARNAULD: Hey, wait wait.

00:13:30.508 --> 00:13:32.575
So I heard of this dream and...

00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:34.264
Well, I'd like to help...

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:37.400
But first I must know
what you're searching for.

00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:39.303
- AMICIA: Alright... So it's... uh...

00:13:39.928 --> 00:13:41.795
It-It's a bit strange but...

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:43.539
Well...

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.124
Go on, Hugo.

00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:46.162
- HUGO: Yes.

00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:47.331
In my dream...

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:49.242
I woke up on a beach.

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:51.735
And... I was sick and scared.

00:13:51.892 --> 00:13:55.173
But... a big bird came and I followed him.

00:13:55.307 --> 00:13:56.987
I thought I was dying.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:59.793
But the bird showed me
water that healed me.

00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:02.271
And there was a huge tree too.

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:04.950
And that's where I wake up each time.

00:14:04.783 --> 00:14:06.463
- ARNAULD: Good. So...

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:08.901
Bird... Tree... And water...

00:14:09.169 --> 00:14:10.849
Hmm... Could be anywhere.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.780
But I guess it's a start.

00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:15.841
- AMICIA: We can ask at the market. Come on.

00:24:05.683 --> 00:24:08.730

She should've been here already.

00:24:07.715 --> 00:24:10.115

00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:18.667
- VICTOR: You all know me.

00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:20.589
I'm not a man of words.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.203
Emilies, your priestess,
she will be here soon.

00:24:25.962 --> 00:24:29.674
She will open these <i>Brighter Days</i>
with her beautiful words.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.560
The words of a mother.

00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:34.926
The mother of the <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:38.183
The child who protects this sacred land.

00:24:36.532 --> 00:24:37.572
- HUGO: What?

00:24:37.603 --> 00:24:39.336
- ARNAULD: It's him, come.

00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:41.106
- VICTOR: From the rats of disease and war.

00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.645
- AMICIA: The rats?

00:24:41.152 --> 00:24:42.512
- HUGO: No, wait.

00:24:42.157 --> 00:24:44.423
- AMICIA: Hey, what are you doing?

00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:46.119
- HUGO: It's ... the Count, Amicia.

00:24:46.063 --> 00:24:47.743
- ARNAULD: We had a deal!

00:24:47.324 --> 00:24:48.524
Call your rats!

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.006
- AMICIA: Wait, what?
<i>That</i> was your deal?

00:24:51.308 --> 00:24:54.277
You've saved me so he would
murder the Count for you?

00:24:53.708 --> 00:24:56.062
- ARNAULD: Usify, that comes with a price!

00:24:55.719 --> 00:24:56.759
- AMICIA: No!

00:24:56.913 --> 00:25:01.790
You <i>don't</i> take advantage of a child
and call it <i>"a deal"</i>, Arnauld!

00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:03.855
We came all this way by him.

00:25:03.889 --> 00:25:05.489
You won't ruin that!

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.616

00:26:05.362 --> 00:26:08.095

00:26:10.261 --> 00:26:12.395

00:26:12.973 --> 00:26:14.926

00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:16.410

00:26:17.025 --> 00:26:18.025
Why?

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.260

but you can change them.

00:26:30.105 --> 00:26:31.105
- HUGO: How?

00:26:32.069 --> 00:26:34.759
- AMICIA: The way we always do. We fight.

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:37.525
We stop Arnauld before he does more damage.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.560
We save your dream.

00:26:47.694 --> 00:26:50.638
We need a way back.
A discreet one as possible.

I'll teach you what it is
to lose what you care for.

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:11.833
- VICTOR: You've always been
a disgrace to the knighthood, Arnauld.

00:32:11.858 --> 00:32:14.223
That you've been a pain
in my arse for too long.

00:32:13.477 --> 00:32:15.211

he was after you, Sire.

00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:31.863

He's a bit afraid.

- AMICIA: Thank you so much.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.966
Those were kind and true words.

00:36:29.995 --> 00:36:31.640
- EMILIE: Let me show you something else.

00:36:31.688 --> 00:36:32.688
Victor.

00:36:32.212 --> 00:36:33.704
- VICTOR: Of course, my love.

00:36:32.736 --> 00:36:34.416
- AMICIA: Come, Hugo.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:36.091
- EMILIE: The land here is strong.

00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:38.987
The <i>Child of Embers</i> breathes life into it.

00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:42.392
We created the <i>Brighter Days</i> to celebrate him.

00:36:42.552 --> 00:36:44.885
In the hope he'll come back to us.

00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:46.105
As it is foretold...

00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:47.071
- VICTOR: To us.

00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:48.575
His mother and father.

00:36:48.254 --> 00:36:51.582
- EMILIE: And to the people.
We pray to him not as a God.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:55.011
But as our long seeking child.
We love and revere him.

00:36:54.925 --> 00:36:56.525
To revive his flame.

00:37:05.964 --> 00:37:08.249
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Amicia, on the stone!

00:37:08.284 --> 00:37:09.404
It's the bird!

00:37:09.459 --> 00:37:10.538
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Wait.

00:37:09.983 --> 00:37:11.713
- EMILIE: Would you pray with me?

00:37:11.523 --> 00:37:13.523
You can do it in your own way.

00:37:13.103 --> 00:37:14.783
- AMICIA: Sure... Hugo.

00:37:14.828 --> 00:37:16.828
- HUGO: I'll pray to the bird.

00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:22.246
- EMILIE: The humble flame.

00:37:22.043 --> 00:37:23.563
To light his night.

00:37:23.584 --> 00:37:25.024
And may he rise...

00:37:24.934 --> 00:37:26.675
A sun... A sun...

00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:27.739
So bright...

00:37:27.564 --> 00:37:29.004
- HUGO: So bright.

00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:30.364
- AMICIA: So bright.

00:37:30.075 --> 00:37:32.542
- EMILIE: Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Shall we go?

00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:36.517
- AMICIA: Ah... sorry... Mother.

00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:40.854
Could we take some time...
to pray for our Father?

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.360
Hugo?

00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:43.011
- HUGO: Yes.

00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:45.111
- EMILIE: Of course, I understand.

00:37:44.997 --> 00:37:46.437
I'll wait for you.

00:37:46.372 --> 00:37:48.052
Come when it is done.

00:37:48.802 --> 00:37:50.482
- HUGO: Dear Father...

00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:52.191
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Hugo. It's really your bird?

00:37:52.217 --> 00:37:53.897
Take a good look at it.

00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:54.591
- HUGO: Oh...

00:37:54.868 --> 00:37:55.868
Yes...

00:37:56.075 --> 00:37:57.075
I feel it.

00:37:57.488 --> 00:37:59.168
It has the same beak.

00:37:59.187 --> 00:38:01.536
And... I just... know it.

00:38:01.616 --> 00:38:03.349
- AMICIA: Good. Very good.

00:38:03.532 --> 00:38:05.212
Let's go back to them.

00:38:04.818 --> 00:38:07.733
And no word about that
to anybody here, alright?

00:38:07.638 --> 00:38:08.918
It's our secret.

00:38:08.781 --> 00:38:09.981
- HUGO: I know.

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.719
- VICTOR: Is evething ready for tomorrow?

00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:35.411
- EMILIE: Yes.

00:38:35.211 --> 00:38:37.145
The new robes look wonderful.

00:38:37.387 --> 00:38:38.907
It will be perfect.

00:38:38.927 --> 00:38:40.291
- AMICIA: Excuse me.

00:38:39.974 --> 00:38:41.014
- EMILIE: Ah.

00:38:41.038 --> 00:38:42.038
Shall we go?

00:38:41.815 --> 00:38:43.015
- AMICIA: Sure.

00:38:44.608 --> 00:38:50.056
- VICTOR: I must say we appreciate
that you pay ... for the child so willingly.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.674
- AMICIA: Every child...
They're the future of the world.

00:38:55.437 --> 00:38:57.571
One child can change everything.

00:38:57.391 --> 00:38:59.258
- EMILIE: That is very true.

00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:07.081
Go on.

00:39:12.295 --> 00:39:14.095
- AMICIA: This is too much.

00:39:13.406 --> 00:39:14.926
- VICTOR: Nonesene.

00:39:15.282 --> 00:39:16.722
You're our guests.

00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:18.531
There's a good dinner being cooked.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.150
- HUGO: A real dinner, Amicia!

00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:20.939
- AMICIA: Shhh...

00:39:21.027 --> 00:39:23.773
- EMILIE: Oh, we'll need to get you
some new clothes.

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:26.065
It looks like you had a long journey.

00:39:28.097 --> 00:39:29.969
- HUGO: Are you going to kill Arnauld?

00:39:29.725 --> 00:39:30.925
- AMICIA: Hugo.

00:39:30.074 --> 00:39:31.941
- VICTOR: He will be judged.

00:39:32.255 --> 00:39:35.683
Although who do bad things are,
and he did a lot.

00:39:35.733 --> 00:39:36.733
But...

00:39:37.378 --> 00:39:40.834
You will have a chance
to testify if you wish to do so.

00:39:41.635 --> 00:39:43.569
- EMILIE: But enough of that.

00:39:43.431 --> 00:39:45.111
We'll leave you to rest.

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:47.686
Tomorrow, feel free to enjoy La Cuna.

00:39:47.779 --> 00:39:50.938
<i>Brighter Days</i> are the best time for it.

00:39:51.329 --> 00:39:52.929
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.896
- HUGO: Thank you.

00:39:53.235 --> 00:39:54.835
- EMILIE: (CHUCKLES)

00:39:54.687 --> 00:39:56.127
- VICTOR: My lady.

00:40:05.749 --> 00:40:08.649
- EMILIE: Beds are great.
Try jumping on them.

00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:10.830
- HUGO: Yes... (LAUGHS)

00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:15.782
(LAUGHS)

00:40:16.274 --> 00:40:17.714
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS)
