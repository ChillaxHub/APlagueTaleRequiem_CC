00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:32.618
VIII - A SEA OF PROMISES

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.635
- AMICIA: (EXHALES)
The sea is so quiet.

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:56.822
Nothing but the horizon.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.891
Enjoy.

00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:02.058
(WAVES CRASHING)

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Animals.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:06.484
Maybe from... Africa?

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.559
Looks like Hugo played with them.

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:12.339
Hope he didn't break anything.

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:15.598
It was so good to sleep.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:18.844
Herbs and unguents.

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.281
The one she gave to Hugo worked well.

00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:23.238
I hope he's feeling better.

00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:28.827
Such a nice bed.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.019
Our captain has good taste.

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:35.728
That smell...

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:39.375
Incense... That's amazing.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.750
Hm...

00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:45.906
The Mediterranean Sea

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:48.294
La Cuna should be somewhere here.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.610
This one?

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.235
Or this one?

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:58.828
Necklaces, rings...

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:01.024
Quite the elegant lady.

00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:09.325
(WAVES CRASHING)

00:02:12.157 --> 00:02:13.157
Hey, sailor.

00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:14.824
Still at your post?

00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:16.567
Anything to report?

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.970
An island, maybe?

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.030
- HUGO: Not yet.

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:21.422
But it's so beautiful!

00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:23.406
The colours keep changing.

00:02:23.454 --> 00:02:25.891
And I'm seeing huge fishes.

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:27.469
Maybe a dolphin.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:29.055
- AMICIA: That's great.

00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:37.828
So... it survived the fire?

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.437
- ARNAUD: Yes, it would take more than that.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.312
It survives Spain...

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:43.197
Burgundy...

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.547
Guyenne...

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.297
Well... Barely at the time.

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:48.735
- AMICIA: That's where it broke?

00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:49.497
- ARNAUD: Yes.

00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:51.458
The only time it...

00:02:51.907 --> 00:02:53.587
...failed to protect.

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:54.636
- AMICIA: You?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.230
- ARNAUD: No.

00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:58.221
Someone I shared my coat of arms with.

00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.325
- AMICIA: Oh...

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500
I-I see.

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:03.783
It's a... sad memory to keep then.

00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:07.077
- ARNAUD: Some memories
don't want to be let go of, child.

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:08.484
- AMICIA: I think I know what you mean.

00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:11.406
- SOPHIA: Hey you two,
the sail's pulling portside.

00:03:11.188 --> 00:03:12.308
I need a hand.

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:15.578
- ARNAUD: Go pull the rope on the other side.
I'll give you some slacks on mine.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.290
- AMICIA: Understood.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.719
Got it.

00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:27.859
I... just... love this.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.180
It's good on my side.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.829
Arnaud?

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:36.909
- ARNAUD: Me too.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:38.132
- SOPHIA: Well done!

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:58.025
- AMICIA: We can't see the continent anymore.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:58.938
Mother...

00:03:58.782 --> 00:03:59.782
Lucas...

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:01.567
I hope you're safe.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.375
Hey.

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.686
It must be great to pilot this thing.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:21.604
- SOPHIA: It's worth all the other troubles.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.470
Come on. Take it.

00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:25.337
- AMICIA: Oh... Ah...

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:27.821
- SOPHIA: Go on,
you won't crash into anything.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.860
So?

00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:44.384
- AMICIA: It's amazing!

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:49.494
- SOPHIA: It's the sea you feel.
It's freedom.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:54.116
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.105
For taking us.

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:59.057
- SOPHIA: Thank Arnaud.
I'm not usually so kind.

00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:00.494
- AMICIA: Oh.

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:03.232
- SOPHIA: He's a bastard, I know.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.450
He has reasons to be, deep scars.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:08.024
Not that I excuse it...

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:08.844
- HUGO: Amicia! Amicia!

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.691
- AMICIA: Oh... Duty calls.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.625
I'm sorry.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.805
- SOPHIA: You're welcome.

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:13.804
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.321
- HUGO: Amicia, come!

00:05:20.938 --> 00:05:23.609
Look! There's something there!

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.859
That's it! La Cuna!

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:45.578
It's exactly like in my dreams.

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:47.469
Thank you.

00:05:51.407 --> 00:05:54.172
- AMICIA: Whatever's there...
we'll find it together.

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:55.673
Island explorers.

00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:56.516
- HUGO: Yes.

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:00.875
You know...

00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:04.031
It's not important if I die.

00:06:04.204 --> 00:06:06.531
- AMICIA: What? What are you talking about?

00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:09.719
- HUGO: The Magister Vaudin told me
I'm going to die.

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:13.409
- AMICIA: God, no, Hugo. I'm so sorry.

00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:14.921
It won't happen.

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.337
- HUGO: Don't be sad.

00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:19.337
I'm happy to be here.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.047
This boat is the best and...

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:23.750
I like Sophia.

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:26.933
And Arnaud, even if you don't like him.

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:30.968
- SOPHIA: Sorry.

00:06:31.344 --> 00:06:34.992
Just wanted to say,
we'll be preparing to make land soon.

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:36.819
I'll need your help.

00:06:36.914 --> 00:06:39.448
Just... Come see me when you're ready.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.999
- AMICIA: Yes, sure.

00:06:45.047 --> 00:06:47.047
I'm happy to be here with you.

00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:04.676
Wow... She only has some
real treasures down here.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.494
She must've travelled a lot
to get all these.

00:07:12.087 --> 00:07:14.887
And now she'll probably sell them legally.

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.404
Books.

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:20.766
Pretty rare.

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:28.195
Ah yes... That's Arnaud's.

00:07:28.627 --> 00:07:31.827
Can't believe I heard him
snore through the storm.

00:07:40.023 --> 00:07:41.956
Is the island still in sight?

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.663
- HUGO: We're approaching it.

00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:45.948
Did Sophia teach you
how to pilot the boat?

00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:47.280
- AMICIA: She did, indeed.

00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:50.022
Mind spending some time
with your old sister?

00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:51.540
- HUGO: (LAUGHS)

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.995
You're not... old!

00:07:54.677 --> 00:07:55.677
Say...

00:07:55.982 --> 00:07:58.649
How does Sophia know the way to La Cuna.

00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.104
- AMICIA: Tools, probably.

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:01.845
There might be some around.

00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:03.226
Or we can ask her.

00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:03.813
- HUGO: Yes!

00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:08.518
- AMICIA: Hi.

00:08:08.103 --> 00:08:09.970
- HUGO: It's a great shield.

00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:11.540
- ARNAUD: It does its job.

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.087
Saved my life ... enough.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.170
- HUGO: I like the bird on it.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:16.859
- ARNAUD: It's a griffin.

00:08:16.652 --> 00:08:18.332
Half lion and half eagle.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.928
So you're half right.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.770
It was my coat of arms.

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:23.942
<i>Courage and Cunning</i>, that's me.

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:25.960
- HUGO: Our coat of arms is a tree.

00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:27.567
- ARNAUD: Ah... It's a good crest too.

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:29.490
Strength, stability, wisdom.

00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:32.154
- AMICIA: That's all us.
Come on, Hugo.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.090
Down to the hole.

00:08:40.994 --> 00:08:41.994
- HUGO: Wow.

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:43.946
Is this really all hers?

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:45.899
- AMICIA: I suppose so.

00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:47.600
Unless she stole from her crew.

00:08:47.355 --> 00:08:49.155
Now this will interest you.

00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:49.985
- HUGO: Oh.

00:08:50.168 --> 00:08:51.562
What is it?

00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:53.508
- AMICIA: It's an astrolabe.

00:08:53.806 --> 00:08:57.444
Father told me once that you use it
to find your way by the stars.

00:08:57.344 --> 00:08:58.384
- HUGO: Oh...

00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:00.525
Can we try it now?

00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:02.858
- AMICIA: Maybe at night, we'll see.

00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:06.803
Hey, look! A compass.

00:09:06.752 --> 00:09:08.432
- HUGO: Can I hold it?

00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:09.754
- AMICIA: Yes, but... be careful.

00:09:09.442 --> 00:09:10.535
- HUGO: It's heavy.

00:09:10.335 --> 00:09:13.147
- AMICIA: That needle
always shows where north is.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.913
- HUGO: It moves when I move.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.942
- AMICIA: Well... Just stop moving then.

00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:19.620
- HUGO: Here... The island
is in the south. Right?

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:21.205
- AMICIA: Right where we're heading.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.611
- HUGO: Can I keep it to play?

00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:26.395
- AMICIA: Yes, but... don't break it.
Unless you want to face Sophia.

00:09:32.869 --> 00:09:33.869
Climb first.

00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:35.231
- HUGO: Alright.

00:09:39.308 --> 00:09:41.339
Hugo and Amicia on deck.

00:09:41.418 --> 00:09:43.151
- AMICIA: Yes, we're here.

00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:44.632
- SOPHIA: We know.

00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:46.663
- HUGO: Listen all, I'm captain De Rune.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.407
And I say we're going south.

00:09:48.549 --> 00:09:50.229
The compass says so.

00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:52.312
So you all listen to the compass.

00:09:52.578 --> 00:09:55.178
- AMICIA: A great leader - The compass.
(CHUCKLES)

00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:30.665
(SEAGULLS SOUND)

00:10:48.641 --> 00:10:50.879
(WOOD CREAKING)

00:10:51.965 --> 00:10:54.587
- HUGO: Whoo hoo!
Prepare to board! (CHUCKLES)

00:10:57.578 --> 00:10:58.698
- ARNAUD: Hi.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.830
Alright people, come.

00:11:02.857 --> 00:11:04.137
- HUGO: My turn.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.942
- SOPHIA: I'll stay. I'll fix
a few things here and I'll join you later.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.531
- AMICIA: Fine. We'll take a tour
while it's still light.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.198
And find a place to sleep.

00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:18.136
- SOPHIA: Sounds good.
By the way...

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:20.859
This land is under the Count's law.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:21.759
Be nice.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:23.199
See?

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:24.495
- AMICIA: I see.

00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:39.512
- WOMAN: Welcome to La Cuna.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.250
This is for you, my child.

00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:44.264
We're so honoured by your presence.

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:45.626
- HUGO: Thank you.

00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:49.910
- ARNAUD: Looks like we have a new king.

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:51.513
- HUGO: Good king Hugo.

00:11:51.886 --> 00:11:53.566
- WOMAN: That's right!

00:11:53.415 --> 00:11:55.215
During the <i>Brighter Days</i>...

00:11:55.134 --> 00:11:57.477
All children are kings.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.243
Just like the <i>Child of Embers</i>
who watches over our island.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.498
Your presence is a blessing.

00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:06.663
Because you're the future.

00:12:06.563 --> 00:12:07.846
Just like him.

00:12:07.924 --> 00:12:11.741
For heal and deliver
all of us from the darkness.

00:12:12.244 --> 00:12:15.089
Please enjoy the festivities.

00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:16.898
- HUGO: Thank you.

00:12:16.518 --> 00:12:17.958
- AMICIA: Goodbye.

00:12:18.415 --> 00:12:19.415
Wow...

00:12:19.665 --> 00:12:21.732
That's a pretty good start, no?

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.647
- ARNAUD: No wonder what the church
would think of this.

00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:28.857
They seem successful.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.563
- AMICIA: Pray it we're successful.

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:34.051
Well, come on, Your Majesty.

00:12:35.223 --> 00:12:35.971
(CHUCKLES)

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:41.709
- HUGO: We're in my dream, Amicia.

00:12:42.255 --> 00:12:45.335
It's the most beautiful place I've seen.

00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:47.546
- AMICIA: It's very beautiful, yes.

00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:50.148
But now we need to find
whatever called you here.

00:13:15.713 --> 00:13:16.913
- MAN: Welcome.

00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:19.008
The market is just up the street.

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:20.545
Plenty for you too see.

00:13:20.288 --> 00:13:21.968
- HUGO: Let's go. Quick!

00:13:21.811 --> 00:13:22.931
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:13:28.622 --> 00:13:30.355
- ARNAUD: Hey, wait wait.

00:13:30.508 --> 00:13:32.575
So I heard of this dream and...

00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:34.264
Well, I'd like to help...

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:37.400
But first I must know
what you're searching for.

00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:39.303
- AMICIA: Alright... So it's... uh...

00:13:39.928 --> 00:13:41.795
It-It's a bit strange but...

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:43.539
Well...

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.124
Go on, Hugo.

00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:46.162
- HUGO: Yes.

00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:47.331
In my dream...

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:49.242
I woke up on a beach.

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:51.735
And... I was sick and scared.

00:13:51.892 --> 00:13:55.173
But... a big bird came
and I followed him.

00:13:55.307 --> 00:13:56.987
I thought I was dying.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:59.793
But the bird showed me
water that healed me.

00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:02.271
And there was a huge tree too.

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:04.950
And that's where I wake up each time.

00:14:04.783 --> 00:14:06.463
- ARNAUD: Good. So...

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:08.901
Bird... Tree... And water...

00:14:09.169 --> 00:14:10.849
Hmm... Could be anywhere.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.780
But I guess it's a start.

00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:15.841
- AMICIA: We can ask at the market. Come on.

00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:27.051
- HUGO: Oh, it's amazing!

00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:28.803
- AMICIA: So many colours.

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:30.319
And perfumes.

00:14:30.383 --> 00:14:33.455
- HUGO: Amicia, can we ask people
about my dream?

00:14:33.348 --> 00:14:36.284
- ARNAUD: Hey, you shouldn't tell them
that it's a dream.

00:14:35.836 --> 00:14:38.736
And don't ask too many people.
You never know.

00:14:38.852 --> 00:14:40.132
- AMICIA: Yes...

00:14:40.153 --> 00:14:41.153
I'll ask.

00:14:46.863 --> 00:14:48.179
Hello, sir.

00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:49.292
Would you...

00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:51.196
- HUGO: Is there a magic pond here?

00:14:50.864 --> 00:14:52.384
With bird and trees?

00:14:52.202 --> 00:14:53.562
- AMICIA: (SIGHS)

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:55.662
- MAN: (CHUCKLES)
I'm not from here, you know.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.529
I just come for the market.

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:58.763
- HUGO: Maybe you have a bird.

00:14:58.525 --> 00:15:00.271
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.713
Well, thank you, sir.

00:15:01.764 --> 00:15:03.498
- MAN: (CHUCKLES) Anytime.

00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.981
- ARNAUD: You're about
as subtle as you're told.

00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:09.625
- HUGO: What?

00:15:09.267 --> 00:15:10.601
- AMICIA: Let's see the rest.

00:15:16.936 --> 00:15:19.536
Alright, let's try to ask someone here.

00:15:20.242 --> 00:15:23.178
- WOMAN: Good work
with the decoration, everyone!

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.420
Oh, and if you still want to help...

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:27.526
We need a hand with tonight's feast.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.530
- AMICIA: Good afternoon.

00:15:32.929 --> 00:15:34.129
- WOMAN: Hello.

00:15:33.564 --> 00:15:35.897
- AMICIA: We've just arrived and...

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.375
We heard about...
a-a beach...

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:40.021
With a pond, not too far.

00:15:39.752 --> 00:15:42.878
- WOMAN: Hm... That's very specific.

00:15:42.995 --> 00:15:43.995
Anyone?

00:15:43.852 --> 00:15:46.119
- MAN: Sorry, I really don't know.

00:15:45.804 --> 00:15:47.274
- WOMAN 2: Me neither.

00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:48.886
- HUGO: There's also a big tree.

00:15:48.585 --> 00:15:52.204
- WOMAN: (CHUCKLES) Well...
We have lots of big trees.

00:15:52.261 --> 00:15:54.594
You'll find some up on the plateau.

00:15:54.499 --> 00:15:55.768
- AMICIA: Thank you, anyway.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.050
- WOMAN: Of course.

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.257
- HUGO: Why don't they know?

00:16:01.013 --> 00:16:03.933
- ARNAUD: Dreams are tales
of the soul, pipsqueak.

00:16:03.965 --> 00:16:05.405
Not of this world.

00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:06.984
- AMICIA: We'll ask again.

00:16:30.361 --> 00:16:33.227
- MAN: Roasted pork's ready.
Who wants some?

00:16:37.544 --> 00:16:39.224
- AMICIA: Hello, sir.

00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:40.861
- MAN: Hello, what can I do for you?

00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:41.865
Need any spices?

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.599
- AMICIA: Maybe later.

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:47.675
We've... been told of a pond of water
with healing properties.

00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.643
Do you know where it is?

00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:50.689
- MAN: Not a clue.

00:16:50.516 --> 00:16:54.293
But there are many ways to be blessed
during the <i>Brighter Days</i>.

00:16:54.087 --> 00:16:56.021
- AMICIA: Ah... Good to know.

00:16:55.798 --> 00:16:58.480
- HUGO: Is there a big bird on this island?

00:16:58.052 --> 00:17:00.909
- MAN: (CHUCKLES)
There's a few here and there.

00:17:00.944 --> 00:17:02.624
Maybe you'll see them.

00:17:02.534 --> 00:17:04.915
- AMICIA: Well, thank you for your time.

00:17:04.487 --> 00:17:06.167
- MAN: You're welcome!

00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:07.738
- AMICIA: No pond.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.624
Maybe birds. (CHUCKLES)

00:17:09.372 --> 00:17:10.372

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:23.447 line:20%
- GUARD: The dancers and musicians
are now in place.

00:17:23.495 --> 00:17:26.415 line:20%
The festivities are about to begin. Come.

00:17:26.431 --> 00:17:28.973 line:20%

00:17:29.022 --> 00:17:30.022 line:20%
Let's go!

00:17:29.872 --> 00:17:32.603

00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:34.232

00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:46.494

00:17:45.628 --> 00:17:46.748

00:17:50.728 --> 00:17:52.664

00:17:52.252 --> 00:17:53.852
- HUGO: Is she nice?

00:17:53.381 --> 00:17:55.514

00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.356
- AMICIA: Go on.

00:18:00.023 --> 00:18:01.303
Don't be afraid.

00:18:03.672 --> 00:18:05.163
- HUGO: What's she called?

00:18:04.894 --> 00:18:06.574
- GOATKEEPER: Lucinda.

00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:09.009
- HUGO: You're a nice goat, Lucinda.

00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:10.839
- ARNAUD: She loves you.

00:18:10.302 --> 00:18:11.502
- HUGO: Really?

00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:12.731
(SCREAMS)

00:18:13.273 --> 00:18:16.228
- ARNAUD: There.
That's <i>"I love you"</i> in goat.

00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:17.817
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)
Are you alright?

00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:19.404
- HUGO: She screamed to me.

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:22.034
- AMICIA: That's called <i>"bleating"</i>.
It's how they talk.

00:18:21.908 --> 00:18:24.375
- GOATKEEPER: She's a goat, you know.

00:18:24.072 --> 00:18:25.672
That's what they do.

00:18:25.384 --> 00:18:27.117
- HUGO: But it's not nice!

00:18:26.838 --> 00:18:28.568
- AMICIA: You were scared, that's all.

00:18:28.362 --> 00:18:30.521
Let's go.
Thank you, sir.

00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:31.963
- GOATKEEPER: Anytime.

00:18:31.331 --> 00:18:32.611
- HUGO: Goodbye.

00:18:33.328 --> 00:18:36.083
- AMICIA: I must say...
She startled me a bit too.

00:18:35.687 --> 00:18:39.023
- ARNAUD: That would actually be
a good way to disorientate an enemy.

00:18:38.738 --> 00:18:42.430
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)
Can't wait to here you bleat in a battle.

00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:44.722
- ARNAUD: (CHUCKLES)
Next time, maybe.

00:18:46.303 --> 00:18:48.715
- AMICIA: Did you know
goats don't have front teeth?

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.350
- ARNAUD: Just like some of my men.

00:18:49.954 --> 00:18:52.763
- HUGO: (LAUGHS)

00:19:03.082 --> 00:19:06.145
- AMICIA: Should we be worry
about the Count's Army here?

00:19:06.018 --> 00:19:07.698
They look pretty quiet.

00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:10.609
- ARNAUD: Hm... Different captain.
Different men. Different land.

00:19:10.641 --> 00:19:11.841
Don't think so.

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:12.917
- AMICIA: Good.

00:19:12.273 --> 00:19:14.383
- HUGO: I hope there will be a dragon man!

00:19:14.098 --> 00:19:16.965
- ARNAUD: I'd like to see a dragon man too.

00:19:21.435 --> 00:19:23.968
- HUGO: All this wasn't in my dream...

00:19:23.515 --> 00:19:25.195
But I love this place!

00:19:25.223 --> 00:19:28.264
- AMICIA: It's all so dream-like, yes.

00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:31.057
- ARNAUD: Islands could be nice little havens.

00:19:30.689 --> 00:19:32.369
But they're fragile ones.

00:19:32.165 --> 00:19:34.232
- AMICIA: Oh, don't get gloomy!

00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:55.909

Stick to the rhythm, alright Lucy?

It's the best moment.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.975
- AMICIA: Who is this
<i>Child of Embers</i> anyway?

00:20:42.706 --> 00:20:45.039
- ARNAUD: A local deity, obviously.

00:20:44.866 --> 00:20:46.913
It's Saint John's week on the continent...

00:20:46.707 --> 00:20:48.532
-The summer solstice.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.374
So it's  probably all about
fertility and prosperity.

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:52.739
- HUGO: Is he... magical?

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.982

00:20:54.126 --> 00:20:55.126
Pagan one.

00:20:54.951 --> 00:20:56.631

By the way,
why did Arnaud attack the Count?

00:28:06.956 --> 00:28:11.756

It's because of the Count that his shield is broken.

00:28:20.635 --> 00:28:22.502

00:34:25.476 --> 00:34:27.156
- AMICIA: A fruit, Hugo.

00:34:26.761 --> 00:34:27.881
- HUGO: Can I?

00:34:27.456 --> 00:34:28.896
- EMILIE: Come on.

00:34:28.393 --> 00:34:30.193
- AMICIA: Sure, Your Grace.

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:31.519
Please go easy, Hugo.

00:34:31.246 --> 00:34:32.246
- HUGO: Yes.

00:34:31.787 --> 00:34:35.051
- EMILIE: I know this all looks
pretty formal but please...

00:34:34.882 --> 00:34:36.670
Here I'm not Your Grace.

00:34:36.925 --> 00:34:38.205
I am The Mother.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.180
I am myself so be yourself.

00:34:40.269 --> 00:34:44.869
- VICTOR: Yes, during the <i>Brighter Days</i>,
all the people of La Cuna are one.

00:34:44.926 --> 00:34:47.689
United around the <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:34:47.611 --> 00:34:48.651
- EMILIE: So?

00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:49.919
- HUGO: I love it!

00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:51.011
- VICTOR: (CHUCKLES)

00:34:50.726 --> 00:34:52.218
A <i>bond vivence</i>.

00:34:52.044 --> 00:34:54.560
- EMILIE: Be careful. They're very rich.

00:34:54.275 --> 00:34:55.960
- VICTOR: So where are you from?

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.445
- AMICIA: Guyenne.
We fled the war and the plague.

00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:00.606
We came here hoping for...

00:35:00.654 --> 00:35:02.014
...a better life.

00:35:01.908 --> 00:35:03.774
And we heard of this island.

00:35:03.424 --> 00:35:05.408
- EMILIE: You were right to come here.

00:35:05.218 --> 00:35:06.578
Let's keep going.

00:35:06.482 --> 00:35:08.415
You must be tired after this...

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.620
...adventure.

00:35:09.501 --> 00:35:11.181
- HUGO: It's amazing.

00:35:10.723 --> 00:35:13.667
- AMICIA: I know...
Can't wait to see our room.

00:35:13.715 --> 00:35:24.276
♪♪♪

00:35:24.374 --> 00:35:27.421
- EMILIE: Agnes, go get a room
ready for two, please.

00:35:27.264 --> 00:35:29.064
- AGNES: Certainly, Mother.

00:35:29.362 --> 00:35:31.042
- HUGO: She's her mummy?

00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:32.641
- AMICIA: No. It's symbolic.

00:35:32.555 --> 00:35:34.570
- EMILIE: And these are our gardens.

00:35:34.459 --> 00:35:35.899
My favourite part.

00:35:35.669 --> 00:35:37.189
- AMICIA: Splended.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.580
- VICTOR: Finally, I cleaned to the basins.

00:35:39.714 --> 00:35:41.980
- EMILIE: Yes... Aren't they nice?

00:35:41.819 --> 00:35:44.638
- VICTOR: You're quite young
for such a long trip.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.160
Where are your parents?

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.550
- HUGO: Mummy is somewhere.

00:35:48.029 --> 00:35:49.709
But... Dad was killed.

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:51.227
- VICTOR: By who? How?

00:35:51.424 --> 00:35:53.104
- AMICIA: Er... Hugo!

00:35:52.607 --> 00:35:55.155
- EMILIE: Victor, don't be so... military.

00:35:54.965 --> 00:35:57.697
- VICTOR: (CHUCKLES) You know me.

00:35:57.733 --> 00:35:59.866
- EMILIE: Come next to me, Hugo.

00:35:59.145 --> 00:36:00.145
- HUGO: Yes.

00:36:00.776 --> 00:36:02.553
- EMILIE: You see those plants?

00:36:02.252 --> 00:36:04.319
Most of them are not from here.

00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:06.662
But we manged to make them grow anyway.

00:36:06.526 --> 00:36:08.206
- HUGO: They look great.

00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:10.676
- EMILIE: Thank to a lot of love and care.

00:36:10.366 --> 00:36:12.432
We're just like them, you know.

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:13.431
- HUGO: But you aren't water.

00:36:12.971 --> 00:36:14.411
- EMILIE: (LAUGHS)

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:17.385
And we need a good soil, love, and care.

00:36:18.057 --> 00:36:20.485
This land is opened to you...

00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:22.861
If you wish to... keep growing here.

00:36:22.671 --> 00:36:26.191
But of course,
the big sister will decide, right Amicia?

00:36:25.769 --> 00:36:27.636
- AMICIA: Thank you so much.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.966
Those were kind and true words.

00:36:29.995 --> 00:36:31.640
- EMILIE: Let me show you something else.

00:36:31.688 --> 00:36:32.688
Victor.

00:36:32.212 --> 00:36:33.704
- VICTOR: Of course, my love.

00:36:32.736 --> 00:36:34.416
- AMICIA: Come, Hugo.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:36.091
- EMILIE: The land here is strong.

00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:38.987
The <i>Child of Embers</i> breathes life into it.

00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:42.392
We created the <i>Brighter Days</i> to celebrate him.

00:36:42.552 --> 00:36:44.885
In the hope he'll come back to us.

00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:46.105
As it is foretold...

00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:47.071
- VICTOR: To us.

00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:48.575
His mother and father.

00:36:48.254 --> 00:36:51.582
- EMILIE: And to the people.
We pray to him not as a God.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:55.011
But as our long seeking child.
We love and revere him.

00:36:54.925 --> 00:36:56.525
To revive his flame.

00:37:05.964 --> 00:37:08.249
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Amicia, on the stone!

00:37:08.284 --> 00:37:09.404
It's the bird!

00:37:09.459 --> 00:37:10.538
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Wait.

00:37:09.983 --> 00:37:11.713
- EMILIE: Would you pray with me?

00:37:11.523 --> 00:37:13.523
You can do it in your own way.

00:37:13.103 --> 00:37:14.783
- AMICIA: Sure... Hugo.

00:37:14.828 --> 00:37:16.828
- HUGO: I'll pray to the bird.

00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:22.246
- EMILIE: The humble flame.

00:37:22.043 --> 00:37:23.563
To light his night.

00:37:23.584 --> 00:37:25.024
And may he rise...

00:37:24.934 --> 00:37:26.675
A sun... A sun...

00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:27.739
So bright...

00:37:27.564 --> 00:37:29.004
- HUGO: So bright.

00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:30.364
- AMICIA: So bright.

00:37:30.075 --> 00:37:32.542
- EMILIE: Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Shall we go?

00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:36.517
- AMICIA: Ah... sorry... Mother.

00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:40.854
Could we take some time...
to pray for our Father?

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.360
Hugo?

00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:43.011
- HUGO: Yes.

00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:45.111
- EMILIE: Of course, I understand.

00:37:44.997 --> 00:37:46.437
I'll wait for you.

00:37:46.372 --> 00:37:48.052
Come when it is done.

00:37:48.802 --> 00:37:50.482
- HUGO: Dear Father...

00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:52.191
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Hugo. It's really your bird?

00:37:52.217 --> 00:37:53.897
Take a good look at it.

00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:54.591
- HUGO: Oh...

00:37:54.868 --> 00:37:55.868
Yes...

00:37:56.075 --> 00:37:57.075
I feel it.

00:37:57.488 --> 00:37:59.168
It has the same beak.

00:37:59.187 --> 00:38:01.536
And... I just... know it.

00:38:01.616 --> 00:38:03.349
- AMICIA: Good. Very good.

00:38:03.532 --> 00:38:05.212
Let's go back to them.

00:38:04.818 --> 00:38:07.733
And no word about that
to anybody here, alright?

00:38:07.638 --> 00:38:08.918
It's our secret.

00:38:08.781 --> 00:38:09.981
- HUGO: I know.

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.719
- VICTOR: Is evething ready for tomorrow?

00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:35.411
- EMILIE: Yes.

00:38:35.211 --> 00:38:37.145
The new robes look wonderful.

00:38:37.387 --> 00:38:38.907
It will be perfect.

00:38:38.927 --> 00:38:40.291
- AMICIA: Excuse me.

00:38:39.974 --> 00:38:41.014
- EMILIE: Ah.

00:38:41.038 --> 00:38:42.038
Shall we go?

00:38:41.815 --> 00:38:43.015
- AMICIA: Sure.

00:38:44.608 --> 00:38:50.056
- VICTOR: I must say we appreciate
that you pay ... for the child so willingly.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.674
- AMICIA: Every child...
They're the future of the world.

00:38:55.437 --> 00:38:57.571
One child can change everything.

00:38:57.391 --> 00:38:59.258
- EMILIE: That is very true.

00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:07.081
Go on.

00:39:12.295 --> 00:39:14.095
- AMICIA: This is too much.

00:39:13.406 --> 00:39:14.926
- VICTOR: Nonesene.

00:39:15.282 --> 00:39:16.722
You're our guests.

00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:18.531
There's a good dinner being cooked.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.150
- HUGO: A real dinner, Amicia!

00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:20.939
- AMICIA: Shhh...

00:39:21.027 --> 00:39:23.773
- EMILIE: Oh, we'll need to get you
some new clothes.

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:26.065
It looks like you had a long journey.

00:39:28.097 --> 00:39:29.969
- HUGO: Are you going to kill Arnaud?

00:39:29.725 --> 00:39:30.925
- AMICIA: Hugo.

00:39:30.074 --> 00:39:31.941
- VICTOR: He will be judged.

00:39:32.255 --> 00:39:35.683
Although who do bad things are,
and he did a lot.

00:39:35.733 --> 00:39:36.733
But...

00:39:37.378 --> 00:39:40.834
You will have a chance
to testify if you wish to do so.

00:39:41.635 --> 00:39:43.569
- EMILIE: But enough of that.

00:39:43.431 --> 00:39:45.111
We'll leave you to rest.

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:47.686
Tomorrow, feel free to enjoy La Cuna.

00:39:47.779 --> 00:39:50.938
<i>Brighter Days</i> are the best time for it.

00:39:51.329 --> 00:39:52.929
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.896
- HUGO: Thank you.

00:39:53.235 --> 00:39:54.835
- EMILIE: (CHUCKLES)

00:39:54.687 --> 00:39:56.127
- VICTOR: My lady.

00:40:05.749 --> 00:40:08.649
- EMILIE: Beds are great.
Try jumping on them.

00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:10.830
- HUGO: Yes... (LAUGHS)

00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:15.782
(LAUGHS)

00:40:16.274 --> 00:40:17.714
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS)
