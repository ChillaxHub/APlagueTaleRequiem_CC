XI - THE CRADLE OF CENTURIES

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.777
- HUGO: They've come here.

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:21.129
Amicia, the people...

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:22.865
It's my fault.

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:24.439
- AMICIA: It's not.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.465
We all know what happened back there.

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:30.113
- SOPHIA: Don't overthink it.
Let's get to the map.

00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:31.905
That's why you came here.

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.801
- AMICIA: This will soon be over, Hugo.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.863
- HUGO: The rats don't want that.
They're happy right now.

00:01:41.887 --> 00:01:45.065
- AMICIA: The rats will have no choice
but to go to hell.

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:46.611
- HUGO: They'll fight back.

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:49.246
- SOPHIA: They're stupid animals, Hugo.

00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:51.732
We're three smart and strong human beings.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:53.437
- HUGO: I don't know.

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:54.674
- AMICIA: Sophi...

00:01:54.294 --> 00:01:56.182
- SOPHIA: Let me know
which fire you want to go to.

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:57.878
I'll open a path to it.

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.429 position:20% line:20%
- WOMAN: Look, survivors!

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:04.077 position:20% line:20%
- MAN: Don't come too close!

00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:06.234
- HUGO: We're going to help you!

00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:08.141
- AMICIA: No no!

00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:11.214
- HUGO: No! Leave them! Please!

00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:12.508
- SOPHIA: Goodness.

00:04:12.047 --> 00:04:13.087
- HUGO: Why??

00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:17.071
I hate you!
I HATE YOU ALL!!

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:19.253
- AMICIA: It's over. Let's move.

00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:20.356
Come.

00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:26.746
This will stop.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.551
- HUGO: It's too late.

00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:30.535
It's all ruined.

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:31.989
- AMICIA: Hugo...

00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:47.817
- SOPHIA: That cart.

00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:49.401
- AMICIA: Yes, it will protect us.

00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:51.180
- SOPHIA: There's something on the ground.

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:51.874
- AMICIA: A beam.

00:04:51.802 --> 00:04:53.482
- HUGO: It looks heavy.

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:55.728
- AMICIA: We need a way to move it.

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:37.767
Get ready!

00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:41.577
Let's keep close to it.

00:05:53.217 --> 00:05:55.617
- SOPHIA: (SIGH OF RELIEF)
Close one.

00:06:20.098 --> 00:06:22.835
- AMICIA: We're getting there.
The map.

00:06:23.156 --> 00:06:25.286
The Carrier... He's the key.

00:06:25.366 --> 00:06:28.913
- HUGO: But it's so old.
He's been dead a long time.

00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:32.351
- AMICIA: There will be something left.
Something to save you.

00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:34.273
- HUGO: I don't care about me.

00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:35.537
- AMICIA: Don't say that!

00:06:35.612 --> 00:06:37.498
You're... everything.

00:06:37.538 --> 00:06:40.312
- SOPHIA: Hey, will you stop
torturing yourselves, you two?

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.210
This is hell, yes!

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.951
But we've got a lead. So we'll stick
together and see this through.

00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:49.263
- AMICIA: She's right, Hugo.
We've got nothing else.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.370
- HUGO: I know.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.444
- SOPHIA: And I'm sure there're survivors.

00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:54.475
Their palace is like a stronghold.

00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:57.947
- AMICIA: True. It's the Count's duty
to offer shelter to his people.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:58.979
- HUGO: Yes.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.040
He's a real knight.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.150
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:07:50.474 --> 00:07:52.154
Up there. It's there.

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:01.729
We're here.

00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:03.255
Finally.

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:05.803
- SOPHIA: To think
it was right under our noses.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.270
- AMICIA: Now, Basilius.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:08.816
Where are you?

00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:15.419
- SOPHIA: Where do you hide
your most valuable treasure?

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:17.165
- HUGO: The ground?

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:17.829
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:21.357
He has to be down below.
The map could be the entry point.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.152
- SOPHIA: Are we... breaking it?

00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:24.429
- AMICIA: I guess so.

00:08:28.384 --> 00:08:29.904
Stay back, alright.

00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:31.305
Ready?

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.045
Push.

00:08:38.758 --> 00:08:40.118
- SOPHIA: Whoo...

00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:41.787
That was liberating.

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:43.207
- HUGO: Poor map.

00:08:43.987 --> 00:08:48.194
- SOPHIA: But... that's too bad
because it was very old, yes.

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:52.693
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:09:16.413 --> 00:09:17.413
A hallway.

00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:19.646
It's been sealed.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.159
- SOPHIA: Sealed against what?

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.829
- AMICIA: Let's go see it.

00:09:32.063 --> 00:09:33.063
This is it.

00:09:34.952 --> 00:09:35.952
Come.

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:39.309
- HUGO: It's too dark!

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:41.839
- SOPHIA: But the dark is afraid of you too.

00:09:41.617 --> 00:09:44.045
Just one light... and it's gone.

00:09:45.565 --> 00:09:48.232
- AMICIA: Come on, we'll find the light.

00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:03.635
Look, this leads somewhere.

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:05.842
This is it... I feel it.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.192
- SOPHIA: We're the first here
in a long time.

00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:09.475
- HUGO: Don't let go of my hand.

00:10:09.237 --> 00:10:11.304
- AMICIA: I won't. Don't worry.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.677
- HUGO: It's getting darker.

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:33.928
- AMICIA: I'll light it up.

00:10:33.112 --> 00:10:34.792
- SOPHIA: Yes, please.

00:10:42.613 --> 00:10:44.898
- AMICIA: Wait, something's happening.

00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:46.114
- SOPHIA: Oh please... No...

00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:51.146
What the hell?

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:56.678
- AMICIA: Look at the size of this place.

00:10:56.144 --> 00:10:57.824
- HUGO: What is this?

00:10:57.551 --> 00:10:59.751
- SOPHIA: Some sort of... temple?

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:01.526
- AMICIA: It looks like it, yes.

00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:29.956
- SOPHIA: On the ground, look!

00:11:29.718 --> 00:11:31.398
The Order's symbol again?

00:11:31.052 --> 00:11:33.385
- AMICIA: Yes... This is the place.

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:34.795
- HUGO: Basilius' here.

00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:36.164
Somewhere.

00:11:52.961 --> 00:11:54.405
- SOPHIA: Look at that door...

00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:55.911
- AMICIA: What a mess...

00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:57.561
What happened here?

00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:01.462
- SOPHIA: Burnt marks.
There was a blast here.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.104
- HUGO: Was it an accident?

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.591
- AMICIA: I'd say they were blown open.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.099
- SOPHIA: Yes, someone really wanted to get it.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.826
- AMICIA: Let's see the rest.

00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:12.666
- SOPHIA: There was another blast here too.

00:12:12.492 --> 00:12:14.172
The gate is destroyed.

00:12:13.857 --> 00:12:15.657
- AMICIA: It has to be her!

00:12:15.349 --> 00:12:16.349
Aelia.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.839
She escaped the chapel.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.423
- HUGO: She just striked all this?

00:12:19.137 --> 00:12:21.756
- AMICIA: She wanted to take Basilius back.

00:12:21.258 --> 00:12:24.330
She forced her way through...
We're on her trail.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.808
There's space behind.
Let's try through there.

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:33.546
- HUGO: We're really going through there?

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:35.545
- AMICIA: Don't worry,
it held for centuries.

00:12:35.412 --> 00:12:36.585
Going deeper.

00:12:36.612 --> 00:12:39.737
- SOPHIA: Hopefully,
we'll catch up with her somewhere.

00:12:41.603 --> 00:12:43.203
- AMICIA: We'll see.

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:03.599
- SOPHIA: Landslide.
If that's her...

00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:05.741
She really shook the whole place up.

00:13:05.394 --> 00:13:07.576
- AMICIA: She was scared for Basilius.

00:13:07.243 --> 00:13:08.923
- HUGO: She was right.

00:13:12.712 --> 00:13:14.392
- AMICIA: It's stuck.

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:21.159
- SOPHIA: Hey, wait. Those tanks.

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:22.712
They held Greek fire.

00:13:22.526 --> 00:13:23.939
- AMICIA: Isn't that a weapon?

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:25.299
- SOPHIA: Not always.

00:13:25.064 --> 00:13:27.250
They must've used it
to keep their lights burning.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.576
One is still sealed.

00:13:28.323 --> 00:13:30.003
- AMICIA: You think...

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.640
...it could explode?

00:13:31.147 --> 00:13:33.147
- SOPHIA: In a tank like that?

00:13:33.277 --> 00:13:34.277
Yes.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.396
Let's try it against that door.

00:13:36.174 --> 00:13:37.374
- HUGO: Really?

00:13:38.196 --> 00:13:40.796
- SOPHIA: These walls held long enough.

00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:41.733
- HUGO: But...

00:13:41.548 --> 00:13:44.424
- SOPHIA: I've done my fair share
of blowing things up, you know.

00:13:44.518 --> 00:13:45.518
There.

00:13:46.115 --> 00:13:47.315
Now take cover.

00:13:47.388 --> 00:13:49.521
Amicia, you handle the ignition.

00:13:49.288 --> 00:13:50.821
- HUGO: Are we far enough away?

00:13:50.688 --> 00:13:53.354
- SOPHIA: Yes, just keep your head down.

00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:04.512
- AMICIA: It worked!

00:14:04.312 --> 00:14:05.992
- HUGO: That was loud!

00:14:06.496 --> 00:14:08.363
- AMICIA: See? It's holding.

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:10.078
Come on. It'll be fine.

00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:31.553
- SOPHIA: Door's pretty ruined.

00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:33.544
- AMICIA: Hm... Let's take a look around.

00:14:58.165 --> 00:14:59.205
Another tank.

00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:05.061
- HUGO: Ah... my ears...

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:06.079
- SOPHIA: Damn!

00:15:06.098 --> 00:15:07.965
- AMICIA: Everybody alright?

00:15:07.411 --> 00:15:08.931
- SOPHIA: Guess so.

00:15:08.304 --> 00:15:10.638
- AMICIA: All clear. Let's go back.

00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:15.126
- HUGO: Dead people.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.546
- AMICIA: The Order's guards, probably.

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:18.592
We found Aelia's trail again.

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:20.601
She didn't like to take prisoners.

00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:22.574
- AMICIA: They pushed her, I guess.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.496
That door was her mark.

00:15:43.754 --> 00:15:47.433
It looks like it collapsed behind her.
How do we open this?

00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:03.546
I think she came through here.

00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:07.722
- SOPHIA: Look. That cart's loaded with
the same Greek fire tanks we saw.

00:16:07.323 --> 00:16:08.323
- HUGO: Oh.

00:16:08.822 --> 00:16:10.889
- AMICIA: That looks dangerous.

00:16:11.477 --> 00:16:13.210
- SOPHIA: Look, crank her.

00:16:12.717 --> 00:16:14.397
- AMICIA: Let's check.

00:16:16.817 --> 00:16:18.497
It opens the portcullis.

00:16:18.383 --> 00:16:20.333
- HUGO: The cart is about to go.

00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:22.804
- AMICIA: Well, off we go.

00:16:22.838 --> 00:16:23.878
- HUGO: Oh...

00:16:27.418 --> 00:16:29.195
It's opened, I think.

00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:32.496
- SOPHIA: You know, I'm starting
to see her in you.

00:16:32.764 --> 00:16:33.764
Aelia.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.350
- AMICIA: Because I'm...
as desparate as her?

00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:38.534
- SOPHIA: Because you don't let go.

00:16:38.287 --> 00:16:39.647
- AMICIA: Well...

00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:55.541
Wow...

00:16:55.894 --> 00:16:57.574
How's it even possible?

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:59.301
- SOPHIA: What is this place?

00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:01.038
- AMICIA: That gate over there will tell us.

00:17:00.745 --> 00:17:02.408
- HUGO: We shouldn't be here.

00:17:02.169 --> 00:17:03.849
- SOPHIA: Well, we are.

00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:10.515
(GROUND RUMBLING)

00:17:10.374 --> 00:17:12.054
- AMICIA: What? No no!

00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:14.840
- SOPHIA: Ah! We need some fire!
Amicia, quick!

00:17:17.827 --> 00:17:19.187
(GROUND RUMBLING)

00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:28.118
- HUGO: I knew it!
This place is bad!

00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:31.682
- AMICIA: Wait, wait.
Those fires... Those rails...

00:17:31.771 --> 00:17:33.797
They built all this to keep them at bay.

00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:34.601
- SOPHIA: What?

00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:36.221
- AMICIA: Yes, we can clear a path.

00:17:36.114 --> 00:17:38.914
- SOPHIA: If you say so.
Where do we start?

00:17:57.007 --> 00:17:58.687
- AMICIA: Ah, it's stuck!

00:17:58.467 --> 00:18:00.800
- SOPHIA: Damn, the rail's damaged.

00:19:01.592 --> 00:19:04.285
- AMICIA: Alright, these braziers can be moved.

00:19:04.038 --> 00:19:07.544
- SOPHIA: Mounted and rails.
Fed by Greek fire. Clever.

00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:10.422
- AMICIA: The Order knows its way around rats.

00:19:10.839 --> 00:19:12.119
Good. Let's see.

00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:54.653
Hey, Hugo. Do you realise how many times
those rats tried to get us?

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.373
- HUGO: Yes... A lot.

00:19:56.517 --> 00:19:59.184
- AMICIA: But we always outsmarted them.

00:19:59.442 --> 00:20:02.242
Because they don't care about each other.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.100
- HUGO: And we do.

00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:05.009
- AMICIA: Exactly.
That's as far as it goes.

00:20:04.743 --> 00:20:07.458
- SOPHIA: Hey, there's a track
that lead straight to the bridge.

00:20:07.178 --> 00:20:09.157
But this wreck seems to be in the middle.

00:20:09.038 --> 00:20:10.718
- AMICIA: Let me see.

00:20:17.037 --> 00:20:18.317
- SOPHIA: Wow...

00:20:17.757 --> 00:20:18.877
- HUGO: Oof...

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.853
- AMICIA: No more cart wreck.

00:20:20.547 --> 00:20:22.524
- SOPHIA: Just have to get
to that other track now.

00:20:22.285 --> 00:20:24.801
- AMICIA: I can't wait to see
what lies beyond that bridge.

00:20:24.509 --> 00:20:28.288
- SOPHIA: Are you really sure that
this Carrier is the answer you need?

00:20:28.139 --> 00:20:29.636
- AMICIA: How can he not be?

00:20:29.676 --> 00:20:32.482
Everything points here.
Aelia led us here.

00:20:32.376 --> 00:20:34.719
- SOPHIA: They're dead people
pointing at each other.

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:36.249
- AMICIA: And they're all we have.

00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:37.276
The truth.

00:20:37.176 --> 00:20:39.982
- HUGO: I don't want to know the truth, Amicia.

00:20:39.582 --> 00:20:41.516
- SOPHIA: (SCOFFS) You two...

00:20:46.604 --> 00:20:48.284
How're you doing, Hugo?

00:20:48.481 --> 00:20:49.761
- HUGO: I feel... funny.

00:20:50.094 --> 00:20:51.187
- SOPHIA: How funny?

00:20:50.987 --> 00:20:53.604
- AMICIA: Come on, Hugo.
We're almost there.

00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:55.857
- SOPHIA: How sure are you about that?
Because this place...

00:20:55.882 --> 00:21:00.004
- AMICIA: Well, I am sure... I'm sure
this Carrier is why Hugo dreamt of this island.

00:21:00.178 --> 00:21:02.977
But most of all, I'm sure
we have no other option.

00:21:02.912 --> 00:21:05.856
- SOPHIA: Fine. That was...
(SCOFFS) Forget it.

00:21:05.516 --> 00:21:07.583
- AMICIA: No, I'm really sorry.

00:21:07.354 --> 00:21:09.034
But we have to do this.

00:21:09.077 --> 00:21:11.783
- HUGO: Yes... Don't get angry.

00:21:11.868 --> 00:21:13.308
- AMICIA: I'm not.

00:21:13.543 --> 00:21:14.543
I'm...

00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:16.162
...sad for you.

00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:17.389
- HUGO: Don't be.

00:21:52.984 --> 00:21:54.912
- AMICIA: We're here. We've done it.

00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:56.376
- SOPHIA: Finally.

00:21:56.729 --> 00:21:57.729
Good work.

00:21:57.761 --> 00:21:58.881
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:00.297
Let's push forward.

00:22:00.598 --> 00:22:01.958
All the guards...

00:22:02.249 --> 00:22:05.149
I can't believe she took them on by herself.

00:22:04.998 --> 00:22:08.219
- SOPHIA: That girl must've been
a one fiercesome fighter.

00:22:08.063 --> 00:22:09.930
- AMICIA: She was committed.

00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:12.445
He was everything to her.

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:15.566
- HUGO: Something bad was happening to him.

00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:16.769
She knew it.

00:22:16.542 --> 00:22:19.009
- AMICIA: Do you know... what it was?

00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:20.874
- HUGO: I just feel... dark.

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:23.279
Like in my dream.

00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:25.041
When I was dying.

00:22:25.065 --> 00:22:27.531
- AMICIA: Lord... I hope she made it.

00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:29.639
Please.

00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:31.269
Give us something.

00:22:35.077 --> 00:22:36.077
So...

00:23:03.681 --> 00:23:05.414
- HUGO: We should go back.

00:23:07.532 --> 00:23:09.999
- SOPHIA: <i>"Protect one, protect all."</i>

00:23:10.695 --> 00:23:13.495
That's the writing from the fort's chapel.

00:23:14.918 --> 00:23:16.438
- AMICIA: It's her.

00:23:17.198 --> 00:23:18.198
Aelia.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.730
The Carrier's Protector.

00:23:24.459 --> 00:23:26.859
- SOPHIA: She really gave them hell.

00:23:29.018 --> 00:23:30.951
- AMICIA: But she died alone.

00:23:34.598 --> 00:23:36.038
What's wrong Hugo?

00:23:36.327 --> 00:23:38.460
- HUGO: I don't want you to die.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.110
- AMICIA: I'm alive.

00:23:40.439 --> 00:23:41.439
I'm alive.

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:43.080
- SOPHIA: Come on.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.460
You're a big boy.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.614
Let's have a look at that door. Hm?

00:23:56.188 --> 00:23:58.321
- AMICIA: I know how it feels...

00:23:59.911 --> 00:24:01.111
Fighting alone.

00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:05.301
Fighting not to be alone.

00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:12.426
I just hope you found peace where you are.

00:24:17.413 --> 00:24:20.282
- SOPHIA: You got any idea
how we're gonna open this?

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:23.661
- HUGO: We should go back.

00:24:23.554 --> 00:24:24.754
- SOPHIA: What?

00:24:24.675 --> 00:24:25.875
After all this?

00:24:26.972 --> 00:24:27.972
Come on.

00:24:30.484 --> 00:24:32.684
- AMICIA: Are you feeling better?

00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:35.846
- SOPHIA: So so.

00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:38.156
- AMICIA: Hey.

00:24:38.363 --> 00:24:39.643
We're all tired.

00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.582
But we're together, right?

00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:49.270
Well...

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.001
Let's open this door.

00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:15.232
A cart? What's it doing here?

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:19.413
Sophia, can you take care of it?

00:25:19.202 --> 00:25:21.002
- SOPHIA: Consider it done.

00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:28.194
- AMICIA: There's a pole attached to it.
It must be for something.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.650
I need your help, Sophia.

00:25:46.547 --> 00:25:47.987
- SOPHIA: Alright.

00:25:53.204 --> 00:25:55.594
- AMICIA: This will open
the top and bottom bars.

00:25:59.283 --> 00:26:02.105
That thing that came out of the ground...
Is that a crank?

00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:03.525
- SOPHIA: I think so.

00:26:04.318 --> 00:26:07.518
- AMICIA: It works.
One bar done. Now for the rest.

00:26:13.157 --> 00:26:14.957
Sophia, can I count on you?

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.890
- SOPHIA: My pleasure.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.103
- AMICIA: Go on, Hugo.

00:26:32.693 --> 00:26:33.813
- HUGO: Uh uh.

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.600
- AMICIA: I think it did the trick.

00:26:43.512 --> 00:26:45.712
We can let go...
You can stop now.

00:26:45.585 --> 00:26:47.265
- SOPHIA: Let's do this.

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:53.289
- AMICIA: It's working.

00:26:52.661 --> 00:26:55.061
- SOPHIA: Yes, this is happening.

00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:58.259
- AMICIA: Ughhh... (COUGHS)
What's that smell?

00:26:58.127 --> 00:27:00.194
- HUGO: It shouldn't be opened.

00:26:59.903 --> 00:27:01.583
We can still close it.

00:27:01.527 --> 00:27:03.794
- AMICIA: No, we'll find Basilius.

00:27:04.989 --> 00:27:08.201
- SOPHIA: Goodness.
I don't like what I see in there.

00:27:08.082 --> 00:27:10.248
- HUGO: It's going even deeper.

00:27:10.701 --> 00:27:12.781
We can still leave, Amicia!

00:27:12.908 --> 00:27:14.460
- AMICIA: No... No no.

00:27:14.484 --> 00:27:16.617
We'll pass that door altogether.

00:27:17.212 --> 00:27:18.212
We're here.

00:27:19.084 --> 00:27:21.151
If you want to go back, Sophia.

00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:22.496
Now it's the time.

00:27:22.395 --> 00:27:23.995
- SOPHIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:27:24.072 --> 00:27:25.072
Let's go.

00:27:25.024 --> 00:27:26.758
- HUGO: I want to go back.

00:27:26.483 --> 00:27:28.163
- AMICIA: Please, Hugo.

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:38.919
(COUGHS)

00:27:40.161 --> 00:27:41.521
- SOPHIA: Urgh...

00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:44.022
What... are we... breathing?

00:27:44.072 --> 00:27:45.752
- AMICIA: Rat's nest.

00:27:45.396 --> 00:27:47.196
But the area's much bigger.

00:27:47.138 --> 00:27:49.220
- HUGO: It's been there a long time.

00:27:48.874 --> 00:27:50.740
- AMICIA: Since... Basilius?

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.160
- HUGO: I think so.

00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:55.498
Oh... I feel...

00:27:55.736 --> 00:27:56.736
funny...

00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.566
- AMICIA: Your head?

00:27:57.847 --> 00:28:00.100
- HUGO: There's... noise...

00:28:00.362 --> 00:28:02.428
- AMICIA: Courage.
What is that?

00:28:02.078 --> 00:28:04.875
- SOPHIA: This is not welcoming.

00:28:04.915 --> 00:28:06.035
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:28:06.411 --> 00:28:08.011
- AMICIA: Let's see.

00:28:20.223 --> 00:28:22.234
- SOPHIA: That did something, definitely.

00:28:22.651 --> 00:28:24.947
Prepare to run, just in case.

00:28:29.727 --> 00:28:31.407
- HUGO: It's a bridge.

00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:33.774
- SOPHIA: This place
is a goddamn underground fortress.

00:28:33.606 --> 00:28:35.406
- AMICIA: Let's keep going.

00:28:39.223 --> 00:28:41.023
It seems to go all the way.

00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:42.527
- HUGO: There's  a missing piece.

00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:43.681
- AMICIA: Ah... yes...

00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:46.450
- SOPHIA: Look, here...
There's a way down.

00:28:46.232 --> 00:28:48.032
Well, it-it's steep, but...

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.030
- AMICIA: Right.

00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:51.296
It could work.

00:28:51.793 --> 00:28:52.993
I'll try first.

00:28:52.795 --> 00:28:54.315
- HUGO: Be careful.

00:28:58.261 --> 00:28:59.906
Amicia, no!

00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:07.519
(RATS BREAK THROUGH)

00:29:07.172 --> 00:29:08.212
- AMICIA: No.

00:29:07.652 --> 00:29:08.852 line:20%
- SOPHIA: Move!

00:29:16.424 --> 00:29:18.001 line:20%
- HUGO: Are you alright?

00:29:18.081 --> 00:29:19.501 line:20%
- SOPHIA: Nothing broken?

00:29:19.314 --> 00:29:22.616
- AMICIA: No... Just... a bit shaken up.

00:29:22.834 --> 00:29:24.274
But now we know...

00:29:24.478 --> 00:29:26.158
...that was a bad idea.

00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:27.912 line:20%
- HUGO: How will you come back?

00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:30.477
- AMICIA: I'll look around
and see what I can do.

00:29:30.544 --> 00:29:31.544
Wait for me.

00:29:31.584 --> 00:29:33.184 position:20% line:20%
- SOPHIA: Take care.

00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:33.611 line:20%
- HUGO: Yes.

00:29:36.518 --> 00:29:37.798
- AMICIA: Now...

00:29:38.135 --> 00:29:40.469
How am I going to get back? Wait...

00:29:40.499 --> 00:29:42.499
Those chains... Countweight...

00:29:42.385 --> 00:29:44.251
They lift the bridge pieces.

00:29:51.955 --> 00:29:54.821 line:20%
- SOPHIA: Hey! I don't know what you did
but it worked!

00:29:54.884 --> 00:29:58.148
- AMICIA: It's those chains.
They handle the bridge.

00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:05.305
- HUGO: There's another piece missing.

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:06.359
Over there.

00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:08.323
- AMICIA: Alright.
Come on...

00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:10.117
- HUGO: She's going to get hurt, Sophia...

00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:11.438
- SOPHIA: She'll be fine.

00:30:11.275 --> 00:30:14.219
She's the most resourceful woman
I've ever met.

00:30:14.009 --> 00:30:15.369
- AMICIA: Really?

00:30:14.796 --> 00:30:16.929
- HUGO: But... she's alone.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.720
And there's so many.

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:21.448
- SOPHIA: You know her.
She's done this before.

00:30:21.385 --> 00:30:24.386
She's stubborn.
Far more stubborn than them.

00:30:25.648 --> 00:30:27.995
This is a war... Terrifying.

00:30:28.062 --> 00:30:29.888
I'm terrified!

00:30:29.768 --> 00:30:32.799
But it doesn't mean
we're not strong anyway, right?

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.430
- HUGO: You're even terrified?

00:30:34.203 --> 00:30:35.323
- SOPHIA: Yes.

00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:37.545
Keep it as a secret?

00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:38.429
- HUGO: Promise...

00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:39.949
- AMICIA: Thank you, Sophia.

00:32:01.726 --> 00:32:04.414
- HUGO: Amicia!
How are you doing?

00:32:04.441 --> 00:32:07.714
- AMICIA: Just perfect!
I feel... surrounded.

00:32:07.741 --> 00:32:10.074
- SOPHIA: Don't get too used to it.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.750
- AMICIA: Good.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:19.950
- HUGO: You're safe.

00:32:19.843 --> 00:32:21.283
- AMICIA: For now.

00:32:20.749 --> 00:32:23.016
- SOPHIA: I told you she'll do it.

00:32:35.254 --> 00:32:36.934
- AMICIA: Here we go.

00:32:36.689 --> 00:32:38.289
- SOPHIA: Well done!

00:32:40.677 --> 00:32:42.357
- AMICIA: Did it work?

00:32:41.677 --> 00:32:44.343 line:20%
- SOPHIA: Yes, we can cross all the way.

00:32:43.954 --> 00:32:46.626 line:20%
- HUGO: You need to find a way
to come back now.

00:32:46.267 --> 00:32:48.267
- AMICIA: I will, don't worry.

00:32:49.172 --> 00:32:51.838
- AMICIA: Please... Make it an easy way.

00:32:51.689 --> 00:32:53.868
He's holding on by a thread.

00:32:54.002 --> 00:32:56.752
Oh Lord... I hope I'm not wrong.

00:32:58.365 --> 00:33:00.917
- HUGO: Keep going. You'll make it!

00:33:01.025 --> 00:33:04.929
- AMICIA: Of course I will.
I'll make all this worth it, Hugo.

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:06.612
- HUGO: I know you want to...

00:33:06.136 --> 00:33:08.812
- AMICIA: No, I will. I will do it!

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.350
- SOPHIA: Well, she means it, boy.
Trust her.

00:33:11.164 --> 00:33:14.108
- AMICIA: Come on, Basilius.
Give us something!

00:33:14.314 --> 00:33:16.673
He's worth it. I promise!

00:33:16.863 --> 00:33:18.415
I beg you!

00:33:26.772 --> 00:33:27.772
Damn wreck!

00:33:27.792 --> 00:33:30.125 position:20% line:20%
- SOPHIA: Hey, you're stuck, right?

00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:32.351
- AMICIA: Yes. Can't go further with my cart.

00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:35.448 position:20% line:20%
- SOPHIA: Go around the wreck.
We have something for you.

00:33:35.195 --> 00:33:36.555
- AMICIA: Coming.

00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:50.302
Hey, I'm here!

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.370 line:20%
- SOPHIA: Ah, are you alright?

00:33:52.138 --> 00:33:54.338 position:80% line:20%
- HUGO: We found more Greek fire.

00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:57.037 line:20%
- SOPHIA: I'll send you a tank
to get that thing out of the way.

00:33:56.678 --> 00:33:59.127 position:80% line:20%
- HUGO: We put a rope around it
so you catch it.

00:33:58.847 --> 00:34:00.287
- AMICIA: Perfect.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.726 line:20%
- SOPHIA: Step back, Hugo.
Here it comes!

00:34:03.793 --> 00:34:05.313
- AMICIA: I see it!

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:25.906 line:20%
- SOPHIA: Did it work?

00:34:25.573 --> 00:34:29.070
- AMICIA: Perfectly. Thank you. (COUGHS)
I'll go back to the cart.

00:34:28.804 --> 00:34:31.471 position:80% line:20%
- HUGO: Yes! Quick!
You're almost there!

00:34:41.984 --> 00:34:44.304
- AMICIA: Back to it. Now focus.

00:34:44.158 --> 00:34:47.550
Find Basilius, grab whatever
you can find and get out.

00:34:48.022 --> 00:34:50.128
Then... Then he'll live.

00:34:58.548 --> 00:35:00.068 line:20%
- HUGO: You did it!

00:34:59.825 --> 00:35:01.317
- AMICIA: I'm a big girl!

00:35:01.185 --> 00:35:02.385 line:20%
- HUGO: I know.

00:35:02.695 --> 00:35:03.975 line:20%
I wasn't scared.

00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:05.734 position:80% line:20%
- SOPHIA: I can attest to that.

00:35:16.763 --> 00:35:19.330
- HUGO: You're here! (SOBBING)

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.604
- AMICIA: Hey.

00:35:21.263 --> 00:35:22.623
- HUGO: You're...

00:35:22.421 --> 00:35:24.327
...here. (SOBBING)

00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:26.780
- AMICIA: What? It's alright.

00:35:26.971 --> 00:35:27.971
Let us go.

00:35:27.702 --> 00:35:30.435
- SOPHIA: Do you want to... take a break?

00:35:30.014 --> 00:35:31.814
- AMICIA: No, we better go.

00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.071
I'm here now.

00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:34.461
Let's go.

00:35:34.334 --> 00:35:35.934
- HUGO: I'm sad...

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.930
...and scared, Amicia.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.880
- AMICIA: I know.

00:35:38.722 --> 00:35:40.266
We've been through a lot.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.777
- HUGO: But it's like...
like it's not my mind.

00:35:42.949 --> 00:35:44.882
- AMICIA: Is it... Basilius'?

00:35:44.949 --> 00:35:46.069
- HUGO: Maybe.

00:35:47.149 --> 00:35:49.349
It's really heavy.

00:35:50.286 --> 00:35:51.286
I'm scared.

00:35:51.576 --> 00:35:53.679
- SOPHIA: Guess that means
we're getting close.

00:35:53.372 --> 00:35:55.505
- AMICIA: The end of the bridge.

00:35:55.281 --> 00:35:57.215
Time to see where this leads.

00:35:58.974 --> 00:36:01.201
- SOPHIA: Urghh... That smell is...

00:36:01.311 --> 00:36:02.511
...suffocating.

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:07.121
- HUGO: Oh... it's wrong... so wrong...

00:36:06.988 --> 00:36:08.417
- AMICIA: What's going on?

00:36:08.085 --> 00:36:10.224
- HUGO: It's there, Amicia.

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:11.531
I don't want to.

00:36:11.282 --> 00:36:14.516
- AMICIA: But we have to.
We have to.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.050
- SOPHIA: Oh...

00:36:17.317 --> 00:36:18.517
It looks bad...

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.121
- AMICIA: Lord... It feels like...

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:23.245
A-a cathedral.

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:24.588
- HUGO: They built this for him.

00:36:24.612 --> 00:36:26.612
- SOPHIA: So, he's down there?

00:36:26.715 --> 00:36:27.835
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:36:27.965 --> 00:36:29.645
At the heart of all this.

00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:33.609
It looks like what the last threshold would do.

00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:36.360
Aelia failed to reach him.

00:36:36.472 --> 00:36:38.205
And this is what happened.

00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:39.453
- SOPHIA: But what?

00:36:39.525 --> 00:36:40.645
What happened?

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:42.523
And what happened to him?

00:36:42.563 --> 00:36:43.952
- HUGO: I don't want to know.

00:36:43.674 --> 00:36:45.239
- AMICIA: You have to.

00:36:45.368 --> 00:36:46.968
He brought you here.

00:36:47.328 --> 00:36:48.328
It's...

00:36:49.061 --> 00:36:50.261
...your legacy.

00:36:50.272 --> 00:36:52.272
- HUGO: I don't want a legacy.

00:36:52.206 --> 00:36:53.806
I want to be normal.

00:36:59.604 --> 00:37:02.996
- AMICIA: Hugo...
Before we get things back to normal.

00:37:03.022 --> 00:37:04.400
You <i>must</i> live.

00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:07.816
- HUGO: You want that but
I keep ruining things.

00:37:07.568 --> 00:37:09.976
- AMICIA: But you don't do it on purpose.

00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:12.436
You're... You're a child!

00:37:12.248 --> 00:37:14.906
- HUGO: There were children
in the Red City too!

00:37:14.738 --> 00:37:16.538
- SOPHIA: It's tough, Hugo.

00:37:17.593 --> 00:37:20.393
We don't know each other very well, but...

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:22.238
I know you deserve a second chance.

00:37:22.524 --> 00:37:23.524
Even if...

00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:25.628
We have to fight it in hell.

00:37:25.319 --> 00:37:26.439
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.410
- HUGO: My head...

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.516
It's... getting... louder...

00:37:32.218 --> 00:37:33.952
I want him out of my head!

00:37:34.505 --> 00:37:36.185
- AMICIA: We're close.

00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:39.331
If he's down there,
so is what can save you.

00:37:39.242 --> 00:37:40.922
- HUGO: What's the point?

00:37:40.963 --> 00:37:43.562
If I keep ruining everything?

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.307
- AMICIA: Stop! You have to trust me!

00:37:45.884 --> 00:37:46.884
- HUGO: I...

00:37:47.189 --> 00:37:48.189
I can't!

00:37:49.184 --> 00:37:50.184
Amicia...

00:37:50.877 --> 00:37:51.877
Sophia...

00:37:51.975 --> 00:37:53.655
- SOPHIA: Sweetheart!

00:37:53.344 --> 00:37:55.144
- AMICIA: Please... I know!

00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:58.169
- HUGO: No... you don't.

00:37:58.697 --> 00:38:00.377
Why are you doing this?

00:38:01.226 --> 00:38:02.746
- SOPHIA: Amicia...

00:38:02.288 --> 00:38:04.291
- AMICIA: Come, I'll carry you.

00:38:04.361 --> 00:38:06.041
We'll do this together.

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:07.419
- SOPHIA: This is too much.

00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:11.037
- AMICIA: I'm sorry
you have to go through this.

00:38:11.606 --> 00:38:12.886
I do it for you.

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:14.978
- HUGO: I want to rest.

00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:16.411
- AMICIA: You'll have it.

00:38:16.435 --> 00:38:18.446
But you must live first.

00:38:19.014 --> 00:38:20.204
I need you.

00:38:19.986 --> 00:38:22.516
- HUGO: I'm scared of myself, Amicia.

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.565
- AMICIA: Stop.

00:38:23.506 --> 00:38:24.626
You will live.

00:38:25.546 --> 00:38:27.039
We will fight.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.590
We will hold

00:38:36.738 --> 00:38:38.804
Come on. Come.

00:39:03.657 --> 00:39:05.257
- SOPHIA: Is that...

00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:06.542
The Carrier?

00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:11.739
- AMICIA: They imprisoned him.

00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:14.731
- HUGO: But... why?

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.576
- AMICIA: They were scared of him...
Of his power.

00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:26.238
This is why they built... all this.

00:39:28.605 --> 00:39:30.285
They were always afraid.

00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:33.039
- SOPHIA: They left a child to die.

00:39:34.498 --> 00:39:36.631
- AMICIA: He unleashed the rats.

00:39:36.512 --> 00:39:39.968
They tore through their walls.
They couldn't stop them.

00:39:41.841 --> 00:39:43.121
It started here.

00:39:43.915 --> 00:39:45.115
- SOPHIA: What?

00:39:45.582 --> 00:39:47.649
- AMICIA: The Justinean plague.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.580
- HUGO: He was sad.

00:39:50.043 --> 00:39:52.138
So sad and angry.

00:39:53.585 --> 00:39:56.785
- AMICIA: So that's why
the Macula brought us here?

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.940
It has to be something...

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480
A scroll...?

00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:02.751
A phial...?

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980
Something!

00:40:04.056 --> 00:40:05.736
- SOPHIA: I see nothing!

00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:07.991
- AMICIA: Aelia...

00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:09.286
She failed.

00:40:10.831 --> 00:40:13.715
(SQUELCHING SOUND)

00:40:13.806 --> 00:40:15.326
- SOPHIA: Amicia...

00:40:15.576 --> 00:40:17.510
- AMICIA: She failed, Sophia.

00:40:17.342 --> 00:40:18.862
- SOPHIA: I know...

00:40:18.275 --> 00:40:19.875
- HUGO: It's unfair...

00:40:20.065 --> 00:40:21.508
When I die...

00:40:21.271 --> 00:40:22.951
- AMICIA: You won't die!

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.727
- HUGO:...I will also kill them all!!

00:40:24.215 --> 00:40:25.735
- AMICIA: No, Hugo.

00:40:25.393 --> 00:40:27.352
He wasn't meant to die.

00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:30.844
When they took him from his Protector...

00:40:30.745 --> 00:40:32.121
He lost hope.

00:40:32.585 --> 00:40:36.335
So he gave into the Macula
and condemned them all.

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.281
- HUGO: He was right!

00:40:37.883 --> 00:40:41.873
- AMICIA: No! That's...
If one word from her had reached him...

00:40:43.424 --> 00:40:45.690
He would've known he wasn't alone.

00:40:46.038 --> 00:40:50.023
He would've lived and spared millions.

00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:53.587
Do you understand?
You <i>won't</i> die!

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.734
I'm here for you...
And I will give you the life you deserve.

00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:59.801
A life without fight.

00:41:00.757 --> 00:41:02.117
Do you want that?

00:41:04.096 --> 00:41:05.962
Let's find ourselves a home.

00:41:06.234 --> 00:41:08.567
- SOPHIA: I don't think they agree.

00:41:08.374 --> 00:41:09.852
- AMICIA: What's going on?

00:41:09.346 --> 00:41:10.754
- SOPHIA: We must get out!

00:41:15.378 --> 00:41:16.610
- AMICIA: Hah... Quick quick!

00:41:16.501 --> 00:41:17.701
- SOPHIA: Move!

00:41:19.408 --> 00:41:20.448
To the right!

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.557
- HUGO: They don't want me to leave!

00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:25.350
- AMICIA: They'll get nothing!

00:41:24.994 --> 00:41:27.660
- SOPHIA: Save your breath!
Stay with me!

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.875
- AMICIA: Hah... No! Up up up! Sophia!

00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:36.553
- SOPHIA: On your left!
The broken door!

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.023
- AMICIA: Yeah... Come on, Hugo!

00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:43.546
Everything's going to collapse!

00:41:43.833 --> 00:41:45.513
- HUGO: They're so angry!

00:41:45.984 --> 00:41:47.782
- AMICIA: Ignore them. Just run!

00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:49.939
Oh no, they're not slowing down!

00:41:50.198 --> 00:41:53.051
- HUGO: It's all... It's all collapsing!

00:41:53.654 --> 00:41:55.588
- AMICIA: We can still do it!

00:42:08.736 --> 00:42:09.936
Come on, quick!

00:42:10.497 --> 00:42:12.017
- HUGO: I'm trying!

00:42:12.352 --> 00:42:14.285
- SOPHIA: Move move move!

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:21.497
- HUGO: Leave us!

00:42:21.427 --> 00:42:22.867
- HUGO: LEAVE US!!

00:42:22.796 --> 00:42:24.514
- AMICIA: Ignore them, Hugo!

00:42:24.237 --> 00:42:25.917
Breathe... Keep running!

00:42:25.792 --> 00:42:27.329
- HUGO: Ur... Sophia?

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.810
- AMICIA: Sophia??

00:42:28.364 --> 00:42:30.044
- SOPHIA: I'm right here!

00:42:29.532 --> 00:42:31.017
- AMICIA: Is there an exit?

00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:32.099
- SOPHIA: Nothing yet!

00:42:32.221 --> 00:42:33.221
Keep going!

00:42:35.906 --> 00:42:36.906
- HUGO: No!

00:42:37.315 --> 00:42:38.135
- AMICIA: What?

00:42:37.918 --> 00:42:39.150
- HUGO: They're coming!

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.409
There're so many!

00:42:40.727 --> 00:42:42.415
- AMICIA: Come on! Come on!

00:42:42.516 --> 00:42:43.956
- HUGO: My legs...

00:42:44.617 --> 00:42:46.617
- AMICIA: Yes... Yes! Finally!

00:42:46.465 --> 00:42:48.798
- SOPHIA: (IN THE DISTANCE)
Come on!

00:42:49.342 --> 00:42:51.681
- HUGO: It's falling! Amicia!

00:42:51.773 --> 00:42:54.439
- AMICIA: Keep running!
Don't look back!

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:56.903
- SOPHIA: Bloody critters! Go to hell!

00:43:00.042 --> 00:43:02.122
- AMICIA: I'll push you up. Keep going!

00:43:01.815 --> 00:43:04.812
- SOPHIA: These bastards are not...
To the right, I see light!

00:43:04.853 --> 00:43:07.192
Yes! It's the outside!

00:43:06.912 --> 00:43:08.592
- HUGO: (SCREAMS) No!

00:43:08.685 --> 00:43:12.141
- SOPHIA: Give it all you have, Hugo!
We're almost out!

00:43:11.882 --> 00:43:15.402
To hell with these bastards!
We're getting out!

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:25.499
(PANTING)

00:43:22.687 --> 00:43:25.343
- SOPHIA: Tell me they're sealed inside.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.287
- AMICIA: I think we're fine.

00:43:27.061 --> 00:43:28.523
Has anyone hurt?

00:43:28.444 --> 00:43:29.444
Hugo?

00:43:29.295 --> 00:43:31.028
- HUGO: It was horrible...

00:43:31.953 --> 00:43:33.073
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:34.769
I'm sorry you had to see that.

00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:36.479
The Macula lured you in.

00:43:36.689 --> 00:43:39.327
- SOPHIA: The Macula
really has a way with children.

00:43:39.203 --> 00:43:41.269
- HUGO: They put chains on him.

00:43:42.624 --> 00:43:43.744
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:44.959
But you'll live.

00:43:45.017 --> 00:43:46.817
That's what most important.

00:43:46.908 --> 00:43:49.808
- HUGO: That's not
what's the most important.

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:53.018
I'm scared to think people at that bad.

00:43:53.312 --> 00:43:55.912
I'm scared of what they'll make me too.

00:43:57.893 --> 00:44:00.026
- AMICIA: You're right...
Listen.

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:03.936
There will always be people
who do terrible things.

00:44:04.054 --> 00:44:05.734
That's how the world is.

00:44:05.967 --> 00:44:08.833
But you have to trust
in your own goodness.

00:44:09.184 --> 00:44:10.864
And goodness of others.

00:44:11.516 --> 00:44:12.796
People who care.

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:14.977
I want you to be happy.

00:44:15.073 --> 00:44:16.073
Friends...

00:44:16.196 --> 00:44:17.636
- SOPHIA: Like me.

00:44:18.678 --> 00:44:21.814
- AMICIA: Friends
make you want to be good, right?

00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:27.110
If you doubt it, I understand.

00:44:27.156 --> 00:44:28.836
But you can trust me.

00:44:29.465 --> 00:44:30.825
You can trust us.

00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:35.352
- HUGO: I trust you.

00:44:36.679 --> 00:44:38.742
- AMICIA: We'll find a place of our own.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:40.470
Let's leave this island.

00:44:40.854 --> 00:44:42.520
- SOPHIA: We have a boat to catch.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.980
And a sea of rats to cross first.

00:44:45.657 --> 00:44:47.590
- AMICIA: They won't stop us.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.100
Everything is different.
