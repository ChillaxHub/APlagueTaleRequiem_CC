00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.461
- SOPHIA: It's a prayer
about life and chilren.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.200
- HUGO: Ah...

00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:46.639
- AMICIA: You'll understand one day.

00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:50.082
Not too tired, Hugo?

00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:51.545
- HUGO: No, I'm good.

00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:53.079
- AMICIA: We've walked a lot.

00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:54.567
This island is quite big.

00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:57.468
- HUGO: It's big but it's beautiful.

00:15:57.662 --> 00:15:58.662
I like it.

00:15:58.735 --> 00:15:59.935
- AMICIA: Good.

00:15:59.576 --> 00:16:00.616
- HUGO: Bird!

00:16:00.245 --> 00:16:03.356
- AMICIA: I think... we've ... in a spiral.

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:06.029
- SOPHIA: And we're getting to its centre.

00:16:36.783 --> 00:16:38.716
- AMICIA: Tell me this is it.

00:16:38.435 --> 00:16:40.115
- HUGO: What do you see?

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.462
- AMICIA: I see... columns.

00:16:41.938 --> 00:16:43.618
- HUGO: It's beautiful!

00:16:43.757 --> 00:16:45.357
- SOPHIA: Nice find.

00:16:46.332 --> 00:16:49.531
Some sort of... uh... antique theatre?

00:16:49.596 --> 00:16:52.938
- AMICIA: Yes, it looks... important.

00:17:01.023 --> 00:17:02.143
Now let's see.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.090
- HUGO: Look! The bird!

00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:13.427
- SOPHIA: And there... <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:15.051
- AMICIA: There may be more
under that grass.

00:17:14.813 --> 00:17:16.880
- HUGO: Are we going to cut it?

00:17:16.363 --> 00:17:17.883
- AMICIA: Too slow.

00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:20.875
I should be able to clear it all at once.

00:18:04.748 --> 00:18:07.811
This is it, Hugo.
Your bird showed the way!

00:18:23.771 --> 00:18:25.451
- SOPHIA: The island...

00:18:25.694 --> 00:18:27.374
It's a map of the island.

00:18:27.853 --> 00:18:29.533
- AMICIA: It's antique.

00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:32.234
- SOPHIA: I'd say hundreds of years old.

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:33.692
Probably by Byzantian?

00:18:34.676 --> 00:18:37.076
There is a lot of those around here.

00:18:37.253 --> 00:18:38.933
- HUGO: Look, Amicia!

00:18:38.665 --> 00:18:40.265
There's the drawing!

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.690
- AMICIA: What drawing?

00:18:49.822 --> 00:18:52.022
- HUGO: The drawing of the Order.

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.933
- AMICIA: Yes... I see it.

00:18:54.444 --> 00:18:56.124
- SOPHIA: What order?

00:18:57.185 --> 00:19:00.085
- AMICIA: A very ancient Order of Alchemist.

00:19:00.756 --> 00:19:03.724
You overheard us on the boat, Sophia...

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:04.797
Hugo is sick.

00:19:05.154 --> 00:19:06.754
It's not contagious.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:12.091
Still, the Order wanted to lock him away
to do whatever they pleased.

00:19:12.229 --> 00:19:13.229
But I...

00:19:13.165 --> 00:19:15.432
- SOPHIA: But you kneel to no one.

00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:16.467
I get it.

00:19:17.601 --> 00:19:20.268
So... What do you come here looking for?

00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:25.627
- AMICIA: Whatever can help him.

00:19:28.618 --> 00:19:30.298
- SOPHIA: It's simple.

00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:32.970
If this symbol...

00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:35.504
...indicates important areas.

00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:42.132
That one...

00:19:46.764 --> 00:19:49.970
Well... That one is pretty hard to miss.

00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:53.199
- HUGO: The teeth.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.397
- SOPHIA: They're called
<i>Las Madres</i> - The Mothers.

00:19:58.419 --> 00:19:59.419
- HUGO: Oh.

00:19:59.689 --> 00:20:01.369
- SOPHIA: I know. Boring.

00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:03.443
- AMICIA: It makes sense.

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:06.519
Let's go visit those Mothers then.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.790
- HUGO: Those teeth.

00:20:07.994 --> 00:20:09.674
Are you coming with us?

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.337
- SOPHIA: If you want me to.

00:20:11.433 --> 00:20:13.113
I told you, I owe you.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.530
- AMICIA: Come on, then.

00:20:15.802 --> 00:20:17.879
- HUGO: Yes. We're gonna climb.

00:20:19.721 --> 00:20:22.165
- SOPHIA: The view from up there
must be quite a sight.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.480
- AMICIA: Oh... I can't wait to see it.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.230
Up we go.

00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:37.415
- HUGO: Alright.

00:20:42.761 --> 00:20:43.761
Look!

00:20:43.793 --> 00:20:45.726
There's a house in the teeth!

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.040
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:20:47.294 --> 00:20:49.468
Some kind of... temple?

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:52.246
- SOPHIA: Sanctuary.
That's what I've heard it called.

00:20:52.343 --> 00:20:54.438
And now I'm even more curious about it.

00:20:54.268 --> 00:20:58.379
- AMICIA: Sold. This is our first stop.
Seems so nice.

00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:29.955
- SOPHIA: So we've got a magic bird...

00:21:29.686 --> 00:21:31.819
An ancient Order of Alchemist...

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.177
The little one has visions...

00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:36.526
(CHUCKLES) Well... just...
What else can I expect?

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:39.067
- AMICIA: Hugo's sickness is...

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.131
...special.

00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:45.082
Our Mother is an alchemist
but she couldn't do anything about it.

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:46.842
It's almost like...

00:21:47.196 --> 00:21:48.196
A curse.

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.521
- SOPHIA: Who could curse such a cute baby?

00:21:50.347 --> 00:21:52.027
- HUGO: I'm not a baby!

00:21:51.903 --> 00:21:53.837
- AMICIA: It's the bloodline.

00:21:54.248 --> 00:21:56.391
This thing goes back to...

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:58.595
...the dawn of times.

00:21:58.502 --> 00:22:00.022
It's unfair, but...

00:22:01.168 --> 00:22:02.848
This is real, Sophia.

00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:06.585
In Guyenne, the Inquisition
came after us over this.

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.605
We barely made it here.

00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:10.208
- HUGO: It was horrible.

00:22:10.723 --> 00:22:12.403
They killed everybody.

00:22:12.304 --> 00:22:14.177
- SOPHIA: Damn...
Alright.

00:22:14.304 --> 00:22:17.248
We'll find what you came for.
You have my word.

00:22:16.765 --> 00:22:18.365
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:22:47.147 --> 00:22:49.614
That's it.
The path to the sanctuary.

00:22:49.274 --> 00:22:51.305
- SOPHIA: So we're done here for now?

00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:53.154
- AMICIA: Yes, let's go.

00:22:56.296 --> 00:22:58.096
It's gonna be quite a walk.

00:22:57.645 --> 00:22:58.931
- HUGO: First to the top!

00:22:58.614 --> 00:23:01.514
- AMICIA: Hey, easy!
I don't wanna carry you!

00:23:01.837 --> 00:23:03.117
- HUGO: Chicken!

00:23:03.012 --> 00:23:05.582
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS)

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.720
Are you tired?
We've been walking a while.

00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:33.239
- HUGO: It's not as high as it looks.

00:24:33.956 --> 00:24:37.066
- SOPHIA: Don't be disappointed.
We're not there yet.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.189
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS) Looks like
someone is more tired than you.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.164
- SOPHIA: I don't like mountains.

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:44.186
Everything I need is at sea level.

00:24:44.312 --> 00:24:45.992
- HUGO: I like mountains.

00:24:45.662 --> 00:24:48.371
They're big and tall
so when you're on top of it...

00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:49.941
You're big and tall too.

00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:52.343
- AMICIA: You know,
it's his first time climbing one.

00:24:52.418 --> 00:24:56.258
- SOPHIA: Well, in that case,
let's be big and tall together.

00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:05.345
Damn, it's getting hot.

00:25:05.425 --> 00:25:08.325
- HUGO: Look! We're almost at that sanctuary.

00:25:08.499 --> 00:25:10.530
- SOPHIA: Do you know what <i>"almost"</i> means?

00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:14.867
- AMICIA: Come on. It'll be worth the sweat.
Look at the size of it.

00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:40.003
- SOPHIA: So what do you expect
to find up there?

00:25:39.577 --> 00:25:41.977
- HUGO: I want to see the real bird.

00:25:41.849 --> 00:25:42.849
The tree...

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.008
Or the pond!

00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:46.190
- AMICIA: I prefer an elixir.

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:48.628
Something to really help you, Hugo.

00:25:48.423 --> 00:25:50.281
- HUGO: Maybe the bird will have it.

00:25:50.377 --> 00:25:52.503
Oh, it's spring water.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.590
- SOPHIA: How can you run in this heat?

00:25:54.943 --> 00:25:56.623
- AMICIA: Child's skill.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.916
He can also fall asleep in a snap.

00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:05.268
Hm... It looks so fresh.

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:06.629
- HUGO: It is.

00:26:07.027 --> 00:26:08.964
- SOPHIA: Just what I need anyway.

00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:09.675
- AMICIA: Hey, Hugo.

00:26:09.186 --> 00:26:11.319
You have some dirt on your face.

00:26:10.806 --> 00:26:12.806
- SOPHIA: I'll get it for you.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:14.048
- HUGO: Ah... (LAUGHS)

00:26:14.128 --> 00:26:16.191
Water attack!!!!!

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.000
- AMICIA: Hey! (LAUGHS)

00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:19.811
- SOPHIA: Counter attack!

00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:21.125
(LAUGHTERS)

00:26:21.158 --> 00:26:22.676
- SOPHIA: Alright, alright, alright.

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:24.806
I yield. You soaked me to death.

00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:26.631
- HUGO: I win!

00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:30.643
(LAUGHTER)

00:26:30.696 --> 00:26:32.917
- AMICIA: Our sailor defeated by water?

00:26:32.965 --> 00:26:35.124
- SOPHIA: He shoved me in the eyes, alright?

00:26:35.164 --> 00:26:37.031
- HUGO: I did it on purpose!

00:26:37.064 --> 00:26:38.867
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)
That's my brother!

00:26:38.677 --> 00:26:40.264
- SOPHIA: Talk about a family.

00:26:40.093 --> 00:26:41.826
- AMICIA: Well done, Hugo.

00:26:41.373 --> 00:26:43.573
- SOPHIA: I'll have my revengee!!

00:26:44.285 --> 00:26:48.014
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

00:27:12.343 --> 00:27:14.372
- AMICIA: That sanctuary is huge!

00:27:14.247 --> 00:27:17.416
- SOPHIA: Yas.
Carving that must have hurt.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.730
- HUGO: Oh... goats...

00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:22.527
There are lots, Amicia.

00:27:22.798 --> 00:27:24.535
- GOATKEEPER: Don't be scared!

00:27:24.218 --> 00:27:27.239
They much prefer their olive leaves
to little children.

00:27:27.263 --> 00:27:29.330
- HUGO: Yes... But they scream!

00:27:29.738 --> 00:27:31.065
- AMICIA: I'm here.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.136
- SOPHIA: Well well well...
Our fierce warrior is afraid of goats?

00:27:35.212 --> 00:27:36.946
- HUGO: There're too many!

00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:39.117
- GOATKEEPER: You're heading
to the Child's sanctuary?

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:39.971
- AMICIA: We are.

00:27:39.484 --> 00:27:41.490
- GOATKEEPER: Er...
I'm afraid you're too late.

00:27:41.378 --> 00:27:43.430
They closed that gate, as you can see.

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:44.507
For the ceremony.

00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:45.458
- AMICIA: The ceremony?

00:27:45.215 --> 00:27:48.128
- SOPHIA: Aw... we came
all this way for the little one.

00:27:48.024 --> 00:27:49.464
- GOATKEEPER: Er... well...

00:27:49.305 --> 00:27:52.313
That goat path to the side
will take you closer.

00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:54.218
But you'll have to look from afar.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.259
The Count and Countess are up there and...

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.064
The guards are on edge since yesterday's mess.

00:27:58.868 --> 00:28:01.332
They won't take kindly to uninvited guests.

00:28:01.197 --> 00:28:04.097
- SOPHIA: We'll keep that in mind.
Thank you.

00:28:08.316 --> 00:28:11.014
- GOATKEEPER: Ah by the way...
If you stumble on Tramontane...

00:28:11.025 --> 00:28:12.873
Please, send her back here.

00:28:13.157 --> 00:28:14.744
She's one of my goats.

00:28:14.552 --> 00:28:15.719
- AMICIA: We'll try.

00:28:15.742 --> 00:28:16.978
- GOATKEEPER: Good luck then.

00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:19.364
- HUGO: I hope she wouldn't attack us.

00:28:20.022 --> 00:28:22.739
- SOPHIA: Oh come on.
It's a goat not a wolf!

00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:24.465
- HUGO: But they scream!

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:26.525
- AMICIA: Oh they do.

00:28:32.558 --> 00:28:34.632
So they locked down the sanctuary.

00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:35.583
Just our luck.

00:28:35.393 --> 00:28:39.542
- SOPHIA: On the bright side, you don't lock
a place down if it doesn't hold something important.

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:42.251
- AMICIA: Yes... I'm even more curious now.

(GOAT BLEATING)

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:46.759

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:48.842
Is that the goat he talked about?

00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:50.589
- SOPHIA: Tramontane, yes.

00:28:51.628 --> 00:28:53.148
- HUGO: She's here.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.681
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:55.729
We should send you back to your owner.

00:28:55.605 --> 00:28:56.965
- SOPHIA: Goat...

00:28:56.845 --> 00:29:00.109
I stared in their eyes for hours
when I was a child.

00:29:00.187 --> 00:29:02.610
You can't know what's going on in there.

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:05.674
- AMICIA: You may just not be ready
for their knowledge.

00:29:15.063 --> 00:29:18.249
- SOPHIA: Wow... This is turning into
an actually rescue mission.

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:20.223
- HUGO: I really hope she's nice.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.244
- AMICIA: I'm sure she'll be thankful.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.813
In... her own way.

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:26.520
- HUGO: If she's not,
we'll lock her up again, won't we?

00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:30.073
- AMICIA: Don't worry... You have
two strong women to protect you.

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:31.239
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.959
There's a hole in the wall.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.200
- AMICIA: Huh... Hey.

00:29:47.013 --> 00:29:48.803
Only <i>you</i> can do it.

00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:50.434
- HUGO: Alright...

00:29:50.638 --> 00:29:52.078
- SOPHIA: My hero!

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.040
He's so funny.

00:29:54.215 --> 00:29:56.481
- AMICIA: Not all the time, but...

00:29:56.224 --> 00:29:57.970
Mostly, yes.

00:30:02.443 --> 00:30:04.243
- HUGO: Ha... Quick! Quick!

00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:06.641
- AMICIA: You did it!

00:30:06.296 --> 00:30:08.162
- SOPHIA: That was knightly!

00:30:07.797 --> 00:30:08.797
So...

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.570
- SOPHIA: Here's our fugitive.

00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:12.467
- AMICIA: You saved her, Hugo.

00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:14.196
Want to say a proper hello?

00:30:14.004 --> 00:30:15.124
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:30:21.907 --> 00:30:23.099
- AMICIA: I'll go with you.

00:30:22.925 --> 00:30:26.816
- SOPHIA: You've done a difficult part.
Don't startle her and it'll be just fine.

00:30:26.753 --> 00:30:28.620
- HUGO: What if she screams?

00:30:28.565 --> 00:30:30.192
- SOPHIA: Screaming not biting.

00:30:30.097 --> 00:30:31.995
Just say it to yourself: <i>"It can happen."</i>

00:30:31.916 --> 00:30:33.116
And that's all.

00:30:32.885 --> 00:30:34.245
- HUGO: I'll try.

00:30:34.452 --> 00:30:36.132
- AMICIA: See? It's easy.

00:30:36.423 --> 00:30:38.034
They don't all scream.

00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:39.058
- HUGO: Yes.

00:30:39.447 --> 00:30:40.447
She's nice.

00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:46.545
- SOPHIA: Alright! She's saved.
You've overcome your fear.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:48.894
And I want to see
that sanctuary. Let's go?

00:30:48.752 --> 00:30:50.561
- HUGO: Yes. Go!

00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:52.579
Your dad's waiting for you.

00:30:53.446 --> 00:30:54.806
She's not moving.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.814
- SOPHIA: She will.
She's her own master.

00:31:00.202 --> 00:31:02.566
- AMICIA: There wasn't any goat in your dream?

00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:06.308
- HUGO: No... But...
Maybe there will be now.

00:31:06.007 --> 00:31:08.907
- SOPHIA: Who wouldn't wanna dream of goats?

00:31:16.116 --> 00:31:18.306 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Thank you for your offerings.

00:31:17.989 --> 00:31:19.722 line:20%
I'm sorry to push you out.

00:31:19.766 --> 00:31:21.966 line:20%
But the ceremony will begin soon.

00:31:22.014 --> 00:31:23.694
- SOPHIA: Hmm... Soldier.

00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:25.425 line:20%
- WOMAN 1: Oh, no problem.

00:31:25.504 --> 00:31:27.370 line:20%
Make sure no trouble arises.

00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:30.639 line:20%
- WOMAN 2: Yes... We had enough violence yesterday.

00:31:30.709 --> 00:31:32.642 line:20%
The Child must have hated it.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.476 line:20%
- SOLDIER: We'll be especially careful.
Don't worry.

00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:38.375
- AMICIA: Well, thank you, Arnaud!

00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:40.356
- SOPHIA: That was to be expected.

00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:49.281
- AMICIA: Climb up.

00:31:53.172 --> 00:31:54.172
Up we go.

00:31:59.306 --> 00:32:01.106
Careful with the drop here.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.030
- HUGO: Alright.

00:32:04.218 --> 00:32:06.567 line:20%
- SOLDIER 1: What do we do
with the last offerings?

00:32:06.377 --> 00:32:10.250 position:80% line:20%
- SOLDIER 2: They stay here for now.
We'll bring it up there after the ceremony.

00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:09.076
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Careful.

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.928
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS) Looks like
they all really like their privacy here.

00:32:14.304 --> 00:32:16.519
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
How will we cross that gate?

00:32:16.313 --> 00:32:18.513
There's no way I can attack them.

00:32:18.427 --> 00:32:20.539
We'll get jailed, or worse.

00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:22.039
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
I have a trick.

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:24.366
This prism focuses sunlight.

00:32:24.408 --> 00:32:27.432
It can scorch tall grass.
You get smoke.

00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:29.529
You get any guard's attention.

00:32:29.421 --> 00:32:31.101
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
Wow.

00:32:30.556 --> 00:32:31.778
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Let's try.

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:35.683
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS) Tell me where
you want the guard to go. Tall grass only.

00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:51.273
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Try that one.

00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:54.035
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
It worked.

00:32:53.754 --> 00:32:55.166
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Great!

00:32:54.627 --> 00:32:56.674
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Move as soon as he's gone.

00:32:56.071 --> 00:32:57.671
It never lasts long.

00:32:57.066 --> 00:32:58.866
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Got it.

00:33:27.497 --> 00:33:29.763
Sophia, your trick will help here.

00:33:29.555 --> 00:33:32.455
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Time to burn some grass.

00:33:35.894 --> 00:33:37.334
Come on. It works.

00:34:13.464 --> 00:34:15.797
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Here's the door. Let's be quick.

00:34:55.905 --> 00:34:58.438
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
That prism is magic!

00:34:58.486 --> 00:35:01.750
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
It is. But we're not there yet.

00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:17.936
Through here I guess.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.027
- HUGO: Oh... It's very high...

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:21.529
- SOPHIA: Oh... Wow...

00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:24.643
- AMICIA: Stick to the wall. Keep going.

00:35:25.072 --> 00:35:26.806
- HUGO: It makes me dizzy.

00:35:28.036 --> 00:35:29.036
Oh NO!

00:35:28.353 --> 00:35:29.473
- SOPHIA: Hey!

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.030
- AMICIA: Hugo!

00:35:30.918 --> 00:35:32.985
- SOPHIA: Oh shit! Bloody hell!

00:35:33.602 --> 00:35:38.379
- AMICIA: You're alright? There...
Alright alright... (EXHALES DEEPLY)

00:35:39.334 --> 00:35:41.381
- SOPHIA: I don't like your stunts, kid.

00:35:42.289 --> 00:35:43.969
- HUGO: I want to go...

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:46.241
- AMICIA: Yes... Let's keep moving.

00:35:47.533 --> 00:35:49.213
We're here. We made it.

00:35:49.986 --> 00:35:51.666
You're alright, Hugo?

00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:54.394
I'm sorry. I was... way too risky.

00:35:54.442 --> 00:35:56.122
- HUGO: I'm better now.

00:35:56.047 --> 00:35:57.914
- AMICIA: Thank you, Sophia!

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.680
- SOPHIA: It's nothing. It's just...

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.710
...my worst nightmare.

00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:04.562
- AMICIA: We should walk a bit...
On solid ground.

00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:17.494
- HUGO: Oh... All this flowers...

00:36:17.573 --> 00:36:20.307
- AMICIA: That must be
for their ceremony.

00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:27.956
Soldiers! Take cover, quick!

00:36:38.222 --> 00:36:40.888
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Heavy armoured. Wow.

00:36:40.661 --> 00:36:43.194
Arnaud really kept them on their toes.

00:36:42.774 --> 00:36:44.742
Looks like we're crossing a line here.

00:36:44.377 --> 00:36:47.084
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Getting spotted's not an option anyway.

00:36:46.767 --> 00:36:49.499
We'd either get killed
or kicked off the island.

00:40:20.033 --> 00:40:22.699
That's a lot of security for a ceremony.

00:40:22.402 --> 00:40:26.896
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS) That's what a place
usually looks like after Arnaud's passed by.

00:40:25.627 --> 00:40:27.738
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
He's a waste of time!

00:40:27.805 --> 00:40:28.845
And of trust.

00:40:28.925 --> 00:40:31.195
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
He wasn't always like that.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.307 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Alright, it's almost done!

00:41:22.126 --> 00:41:25.823 line:20%
I'm locking the gate.
The sanctuary's off-limits.

00:41:25.856 --> 00:41:28.012 line:20%
Except for the chosen ones.

00:41:28.251 --> 00:41:30.212
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
There goes our visit.

00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:35.098
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
No no. We will make a good progress.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.558
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
There's a big broken tower there.

00:41:36.273 --> 00:41:37.953
Maybe we could climb it?

00:41:38.127 --> 00:41:39.920
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
There're stairs, I think.

00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:42.000
Could be an abandoned access point.

00:41:41.653 --> 00:41:44.661
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Well spotted. Let's try it.

00:43:43.129 --> 00:43:47.289
Sophia, have you heard anything
about the Order during your visit?

00:43:47.312 --> 00:43:51.089
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS) No.
Only the Child, the Mother, and the Father.

00:44:57.172 --> 00:44:59.727
We're doing it, my friends.
We're getting there.

00:45:07.841 --> 00:45:09.841
- AMICIA: (SIGH OF RELIEF)
Yes.

00:45:09.731 --> 00:45:11.411
How do you feel, Hugo?

00:45:11.153 --> 00:45:12.833
- HUGO: I feel funny.

00:45:12.851 --> 00:45:13.851
But good.

00:45:14.386 --> 00:45:17.330
I'm sure there's something
inside the mountain.

00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:18.759
- AMICIA: I feel it too.

00:45:18.233 --> 00:45:20.766
- SOPHIA: Well, I'm trusting you both.

00:45:18.693 --> 00:45:21.591 line:20%
- VICTOR: Everyone.
It is almost time.

00:45:21.639 --> 00:45:23.466 line:20%
- EMILIE: Gather 'round, please.

00:45:23.006 --> 00:45:25.673
- HUGO: It's the Count and the Countess.

00:45:25.365 --> 00:45:27.238
- AMICIA: It seems we're right on time.

00:45:26.937 --> 00:45:29.457 line:20%
- EMILIE: We're still waiting
for a few late comers.

00:45:29.553 --> 00:45:31.880 line:20%
Feel free to come closer
in the mean time.

00:45:32.007 --> 00:45:33.340
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Late comers?

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:34.801
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
I'd say that's us?

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:36.007
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
What are we going to do?

00:45:38.756 --> 00:45:40.823
- VICTOR: Friends and children.

00:45:41.584 --> 00:45:44.251
Today marks the longest day of the year.

00:45:45.234 --> 00:45:49.400
The light of the summer solistice
shines upon us once again.

00:45:49.864 --> 00:45:51.464
- EMILIE: And yet...

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.596
In these cold hallways...

00:45:53.742 --> 00:45:55.342
Hidden from the sun.

00:45:55.821 --> 00:45:58.691
But <i>Child of Embers</i> still slumbers.

00:45:59.594 --> 00:46:02.728
- VICTOR: It is time
to bring the flame of the phoenix.

00:46:02.636 --> 00:46:03.998
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) The phoenix.

00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:05.109
- VICTOR: To his dormant embers.

00:46:04.276 --> 00:46:06.054
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
That's your bird.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.654
- EMILIE: Thus we will prove
that we deserve to care for him.

00:46:10.329 --> 00:46:11.329
Like Mother.

00:46:11.823 --> 00:46:13.503
- VICTOR: Like Father.

00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:19.869
- EMILIE: Let us pray together,
before we enter.

00:46:21.693 --> 00:46:23.426
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Come.

00:46:33.438 --> 00:46:34.878
What do you think?

00:46:35.538 --> 00:46:37.604
- SOPHIA: Bold, but believable.

00:46:37.879 --> 00:46:39.679
- HUGO: Are we dressing up?

00:47:10.588 --> 00:47:12.921
- VICTOR: Open your mind and heart.

00:47:12.975 --> 00:47:15.407
It is now time to tell his tale.

00:47:15.515 --> 00:47:17.868
- EMILIE: So that it is never forgotten.

00:47:17.657 --> 00:47:19.376
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
What do we do?

00:47:19.076 --> 00:47:21.113
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Let's follow them on our turn.

00:47:20.928 --> 00:47:22.448
And do as they say.

00:47:22.347 --> 00:47:24.081
They mustn't recognise us.

00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:25.289
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Yes.

00:47:24.527 --> 00:47:25.967
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Come on.

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:35.267
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Wow.

00:47:36.021 --> 00:47:37.701
Amicia, look up there!

00:47:37.904 --> 00:47:39.621
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
The symbol of the Order.

00:47:39.807 --> 00:47:41.734
This place belongs to them.

00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:43.495
- VICTOR: Centuries ago...

00:47:43.697 --> 00:47:46.196
A child was born on this land.

00:47:46.804 --> 00:47:49.268
His heart was blessed by the sun.

00:47:49.876 --> 00:47:53.460
From which he inherited the flame
that rules everything.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.133
And so was born the <i>Child of Fire</i>.

00:47:57.186 --> 00:47:58.282
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) What?

00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:00.526
- EMILIE: His flame shone over the world.

00:48:00.619 --> 00:48:02.685
He blessed it with his perfume.

00:48:02.751 --> 00:48:04.633
His laughter, his joy.

00:48:04.699 --> 00:48:07.599
- VICTOR: Of all places,
La Cuna was his home.

00:48:08.229 --> 00:48:10.832
It become a land of life and peace.

00:48:11.216 --> 00:48:12.750
A place to heal.

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:14.310
To thrive.

00:48:14.478 --> 00:48:17.030
La Cuna became a cradle of light.

00:48:17.271 --> 00:48:19.741
- EMILIE: But light tames evil...

00:48:19.623 --> 00:48:22.721
- VICTOR: And evil knows no mercy.

00:48:22.748 --> 00:48:23.948
- EMILIE: Come.

00:48:25.715 --> 00:48:27.817
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
A child on a throne.

00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:29.339
In an Order's temple.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.332
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
It's him. The <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:48:34.435 --> 00:48:36.968
- EMILIE: Take your place at our side.

00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:40.176
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
Look! The drawing.

00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:42.147
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
It's the Carrier of the Macula.

00:48:42.028 --> 00:48:45.036
That fresco was in Mother's laboratory at home.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.530
- VICTOR: Please kneel.

00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:52.046
Evil found the child inside these very halls.

00:48:52.058 --> 00:48:53.766
It fed on his fire.

00:48:53.812 --> 00:48:54.812
Weakened it.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:57.992
Marked his flesh with cold black scars.

00:48:58.046 --> 00:49:00.946
His mother's arms couldn't warm him anymore.

00:49:00.817 --> 00:49:03.205
- EMILIE: And so his light faded.

00:49:03.312 --> 00:49:04.592
Almost entirely.

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:10.176
And the <i>Child of Fire</i> turned
into the <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:49:10.255 --> 00:49:11.658
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Lord...

00:49:11.216 --> 00:49:13.016
- EMILIE: A dark era began.

00:49:13.201 --> 00:49:15.877
Men forgot about him.
But we did not.

00:49:16.422 --> 00:49:20.696
This flame is the last gleam of his light.

00:49:21.264 --> 00:49:22.264
Our hope.

00:49:22.678 --> 00:49:24.278
And now, two of you.

00:49:24.459 --> 00:49:26.059
A woman and a child...

00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:28.591
...will carry it through his night.

00:49:32.685 --> 00:49:33.685
You.

00:49:34.227 --> 00:49:35.742
Your heads are bent.

00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:37.622
Your humility honoures you.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.793
You will walk his flame,
through his darkest hours.

00:49:41.824 --> 00:49:42.824
Take it.

00:49:48.062 --> 00:49:49.862
You will walk in his steps.

00:49:50.413 --> 00:49:52.960
Know the cold that bites the flesh.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.946
The drowning in the absence of light.

00:49:56.204 --> 00:49:57.484
The uncertainty.

00:49:57.331 --> 00:50:01.043
You will see the child died
through the eyes of his mother.

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:04.342
You will be the victim and the witness.

00:50:04.445 --> 00:50:06.595
Keep that torch alive.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.994
At all costs.

00:50:08.017 --> 00:50:11.747
- VICTOR: The Carrier has been chosen.
Take your places.

00:50:12.356 --> 00:50:13.947
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) What do we do?

00:50:13.755 --> 00:50:15.531
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
We have to play along.

00:50:15.192 --> 00:50:16.639
Let's... cross.

00:50:19.229 --> 00:50:22.096
- EMILIE: Go forth and bring him the light.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.640
Much depends on it.

00:50:31.159 --> 00:50:32.839
- AMICIA: This is unreal!

00:50:31.534 --> 00:50:33.214
- HUGO: Ah... It's cold.

00:50:32.641 --> 00:50:34.374
- AMICIA: Those frescos...

00:50:34.176 --> 00:50:35.216
The plague...

00:50:36.104 --> 00:50:38.697
They think it was caused by the child's death.

00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:40.774
So they don't have the Macula...

00:50:40.825 --> 00:50:42.625
- AMICIA: I don't think so.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.253
They interpreted all this.

00:50:44.878 --> 00:50:46.318
They made him God.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.560
Out of the Carrier of the Macula.

00:50:48.439 --> 00:50:51.511
- HUGO: Amicia, the water
will put out the torch.

00:50:51.746 --> 00:50:54.365
- AMICIA: I think... it's part of their ritual.

00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:56.745

00:51:06.108 --> 00:51:07.785
It was horrible!

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.670
- AMICIA: But you did it.

00:51:09.521 --> 00:51:11.655
- HUGO: I though I was drowning.

00:51:11.812 --> 00:51:14.212

You're fine now.

00:51:14.716 --> 00:51:16.396

You are not alone anymore.

00:51:47.675 --> 00:51:50.147
I am the Mother and I welcome him.

00:51:50.821 --> 00:51:51.941
Pass it to me.

00:51:53.754 --> 00:51:54.794

00:51:58.759 --> 00:51:59.959
Hear me, child.

I am not barren anymore
for your flame lives in me.

00:52:05.231 --> 00:52:06.511
I am the Mother.

Come, I found a passage back there.

we ignite his flame.

They'll see we're gone.

Not for now. We all look the same.

Are you alright?

00:53:13.695 --> 00:53:16.154
I saw a phoenix on that door

- AMICIA: There's no <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:21.119
I told you about the Order.

00:54:21.323 --> 00:54:23.190
This place belonged to them.

Anyway, they got it all wrong.

00:58:46.657 --> 00:58:48.337
- AMICIA: <i>King Basilius.</i>

00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:57.156
Look at that.

00:58:57.243 --> 00:58:58.283
- HUGO: Hm...

00:58:57.815 --> 00:58:59.495
- AMICIA: They're people.

00:58:59.526 --> 00:59:01.206
Important ones, maybe?

00:59:00.996 --> 00:59:02.516
- SOPHIA: Prophets?

00:59:02.419 --> 00:59:04.069
Are there prophets in the Order?

00:59:03.736 --> 00:59:05.416
- HUGO: They're villans.

00:59:04.984 --> 00:59:07.475
I think he shot at them
with this ball here.

00:59:07.288 --> 00:59:09.971
- SOPHIA: Hm... Makes sense. Boys...

00:59:10.035 --> 00:59:11.968
- HUGO: I like this game too.

00:59:11.636 --> 00:59:14.102
- AMICIA: Come. We've barely started.

00:59:18.359 --> 00:59:19.479
- HUGO: Wow...

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:21.397
- AMICIA: That's... a warrior's room.

00:59:21.114 --> 00:59:23.181
- SOPHIA: Not just any warrior.

00:59:22.719 --> 00:59:24.919
Look at the shape of the armour.

00:59:28.057 --> 00:59:29.390
- AMICIA: What of it?

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:30.996
- SOPHIA: It's a lady's armour.

00:59:30.485 --> 00:59:32.977
- AMICIA: Oh... Aelia...

00:59:33.338 --> 00:59:35.205
This is her room, of course.

00:59:35.555 --> 00:59:37.235
She was his Protector.

00:59:36.978 --> 00:59:38.578
- SOPHIA: Protector?

00:59:38.448 --> 00:59:40.765
- AMICIA: The Carrier's personal guard.

00:59:40.448 --> 00:59:43.034
Like... me for Hugo.

00:59:43.051 --> 00:59:44.784
- HUGO: She looked strong.

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:55.850
- AMICIA: Toys.

00:59:55.968 --> 00:59:58.152
He was come here to play with her.

00:59:57.708 --> 00:59:59.441
- SOPHIA: And she let him.

00:59:59.671 --> 01:00:01.804
She was the best kind of knight.

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:03.983
- HUGO: I would've loved to meet them.

01:00:11.319 --> 01:00:13.185
- AMICIA: Swords and spears.

01:00:13.204 --> 01:00:15.537
- HUGO: Wow... Look at the axe too.

01:00:15.906 --> 01:00:18.081
- SOPHIA: I wonder if they were put to use.

01:00:17.795 --> 01:00:20.303
- AMICIA: They built this place to avoid it.

01:00:20.085 --> 01:00:21.952
The Carrier draws attention.

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:23.985
- SOPHIA: Valuable tiny creatures.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.346
- AMICIA: Look, wax tablets.

01:00:31.436 --> 01:00:32.636
They're carved.

01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:34.068
- HUGO: He drew her.

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:35.963
And there...

01:00:36.464 --> 01:00:38.144
He drew himself with her.

01:00:38.578 --> 01:00:39.618
He loved her.

01:00:39.556 --> 01:00:43.204
- AMICIA: It looks like
they spent a lot of time together.

01:00:43.084 --> 01:00:44.124
Just like us.

01:00:44.157 --> 01:00:46.871
- SOPHIA: This is... so strange.

01:00:46.634 --> 01:00:47.914
- AMICIA: It is.

01:00:48.406 --> 01:00:49.526
Let's keep on.

01:00:54.129 --> 01:00:55.249
This is crazy.

01:00:55.662 --> 01:00:57.342
- HUGO: I feel like...

01:00:57.367 --> 01:00:58.967
...like I know them.

01:00:59.552 --> 01:01:01.886
Like Basil could've been my friend.

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:03.278
- AMICIA: I know what you mean.

01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:05.341
- HUGO: Oh... Look!

01:01:05.405 --> 01:01:07.605
- SOPHIA: Huh... That bird again.

01:01:07.452 --> 01:01:09.132
- AMICIA: Its shape...

01:01:09.017 --> 01:01:11.445
It's... the Order symbol.

01:01:11.614 --> 01:01:13.214
- HUGO: The phoenix...

01:01:13.242 --> 01:01:15.322
...is the Order.

01:01:15.608 --> 01:01:17.830
It's just that.

01:01:18.032 --> 01:01:20.507
- SOPHIA: Um... Sorry boy.

01:01:20.587 --> 01:01:22.187
- HUGO: But... no...

01:01:23.617 --> 01:01:28.161
- SOPHIA: That explains why it stands
above the Child on their frescos.

01:01:27.938 --> 01:01:30.255
- HUGO: They thought
they were better than him.

01:01:29.827 --> 01:01:32.144
They didn't care about him!

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.776
- AMICIA: It doesn't change why we're here.

01:01:34.538 --> 01:01:37.173
Come. Let's finish this first, right?

01:01:37.269 --> 01:01:38.309
- HUGO: Hm...

01:02:00.006 --> 01:02:01.686
- AMICIA: I'll be damned.

01:02:01.244 --> 01:02:02.604
- SOPHIA: (GASPS)

01:02:02.914 --> 01:02:04.194
What's this now?

01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:05.940
- AMICIA: An alchemy laboratory.

01:02:05.623 --> 01:02:07.423
- HUGO: Can we go back now?

01:02:08.087 --> 01:02:10.921
- SOPHIA: But it looks exactly
what you're searching for, no?

01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:12.121
- HUGO: Yes...

01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:13.335
But...

01:02:14.107 --> 01:02:15.440
- AMICIA: No, you're right.

01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:19.576
Look for anything that could lead
to an elixir. A-a potion like...

01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:22.135
Books, drawings...
Maybe raw materials.

01:02:22.199 --> 01:02:23.479
- SOPHIA: On it.

01:02:33.039 --> 01:02:36.292
- AMICIA: That... I don't even know
what it's used for...

01:02:36.175 --> 01:02:37.975
Come on. Give me something!

01:02:37.995 --> 01:02:40.106
- SOPHIA: There's nothing much. Arh!

01:02:39.884 --> 01:02:42.684
- AMICIA: The phoenix.
Look for a phoenix.

01:02:46.911 --> 01:02:49.006
What were they making in these things?

01:02:48.625 --> 01:02:50.974
Lord... Give me something, please.

01:02:51.022 --> 01:02:54.112
This is all centuries old.
What do you expect?

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:57.349
Empty.

01:02:57.556 --> 01:02:59.317
No! What the hell!

01:02:59.349 --> 01:03:01.682
- SOPHIA: Hey! Quieter!

01:03:01.784 --> 01:03:03.464
We will find something!

01:03:03.244 --> 01:03:04.924
AMICIA: Nah... Sorry...

01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:06.607
Lucas would know.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:07.749
He would.

01:03:08.792 --> 01:03:11.045
Hugo, did you find something?

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:12.821
- HUGO: This table...

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:14.877
They put him on it.

01:03:15.311 --> 01:03:17.111
- AMICIA: Wait, I'm coming.

01:03:23.435 --> 01:03:25.435
Hey, something's wrong?

01:03:25.531 --> 01:03:27.864
- HUGO: I'm sure they hurt him too.

01:03:28.265 --> 01:03:32.153
- AMICIA: Hey, I know things
aren't turning out the way you expected.

01:03:31.947 --> 01:03:32.947
But...

01:03:32.693 --> 01:03:35.160
- HUGO: Nothing ever changes, Amicia!

01:03:35.741 --> 01:03:38.853
- AMICIA: But Aelia
wouldn't let them hurt him, right?

01:03:38.685 --> 01:03:39.805
- HUGO: You...

01:03:40.488 --> 01:03:42.376
You let Vaudin...

01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:43.916
- AMICIA: No! I...

01:03:44.107 --> 01:03:45.821
I tried to stop it.

01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:46.901
But...

01:03:46.345 --> 01:03:47.705
- HUGO: I-I know.

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.125
You tried.

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:51.430
Sorry.

01:03:55.318 --> 01:03:57.518
- SOPHIA: Hey, come here you two.

01:03:57.159 --> 01:03:58.666
- AMICIA: Sophia? Where are you?

01:03:58.715 --> 01:03:59.937
- SOPHIA: Upstairs.

01:03:59.684 --> 01:04:01.240
- HUGO: How did you get there?

01:04:00.986 --> 01:04:03.320
- SOPHIA: Look behind the curtains.

01:04:15.455 --> 01:04:17.135
- AMICIA: Come on, Hugo.

01:04:16.851 --> 01:04:18.531
- HUGO: What is this?

01:04:18.026 --> 01:04:22.575
- AMICIA: No door. Some sort of...
observation hallway?

01:04:34.439 --> 01:04:35.439
Oh...

01:04:36.058 --> 01:04:37.658
What have you found?

01:04:37.147 --> 01:04:39.347
- SOPHIA: Your alchemist library.

01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:42.477
Looks like they were observing
the child from here.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:44.470
- HUGO: Like he was in a cage.

01:04:44.201 --> 01:04:46.639
- AMICIA: We were right
about the laboratory table.

01:04:46.226 --> 01:04:47.746
- HUGO: It's wrong.

01:04:47.515 --> 01:04:50.651
- SOPHIA: Imagine these bastards
standing there...

01:04:50.573 --> 01:04:51.933
Looking at him...

01:04:51.646 --> 01:04:53.725
- AMICIA: We have to focus
on what they learnt.

01:04:53.519 --> 01:04:55.074
- SOPHIA: I may have a lead.

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:56.360
- AMICIA: Any mention of a cure?

01:04:56.106 --> 01:04:58.773
- SOPHIA: No, but they took other notes.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.013
- AMICIA: What is it?

01:05:05.238 --> 01:05:09.569
- SOPHIA: Your alchemists wrote down
everything that happened to the Carrier.

01:05:09.396 --> 01:05:11.076
It's sorted by date.

01:05:11.358 --> 01:05:12.957
The last entry...

01:05:13.048 --> 01:05:16.166
...was in the year... 541.

01:05:16.378 --> 01:05:18.418
- AMICIA: 541...

01:05:18.525 --> 01:05:19.885
What does it say?

01:05:20.798 --> 01:05:24.021
- SOPHIA: I haven't studied Latin
since the Convern but...

01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:25.781
It talks about Basilius.

01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:28.981
And... er...

01:05:29.703 --> 01:05:30.703
Hmm...

01:05:30.955 --> 01:05:34.114
Aelias Dragas, his Protector.

01:05:34.705 --> 01:05:37.038
- AMICIA: It really did all happen.

01:05:37.317 --> 01:05:38.997
They were just like us.

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:41.290
- HUGO: What happened to them?

01:05:42.783 --> 01:05:45.901
- SOPHIA: <i>"The Order took away
the Carrier from her...</i>

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.223
<i>"She rebelled...</i>

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:52.444
<i>"And was arrested...
close to... a round tower.</i>

01:05:52.752 --> 01:05:54.600
<i>"They took her to...</i> er....

01:05:54.725 --> 01:05:58.361
Er... A capella... A-A
chapel. Inside a fort.

01:05:58.452 --> 01:06:00.719
- HUGO: And Basilius, where is he?

01:06:02.176 --> 01:06:03.856
- SOPHIA: It doesn't say.

01:06:04.452 --> 01:06:06.794
- AMICIA: Well, we have something to go on.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.382
A fort... A round tower.

01:06:08.689 --> 01:06:09.910
(DOOR OPENS)

01:06:13.138 --> 01:06:14.818
- HUGO: They're coming.

01:06:14.879 --> 01:06:16.828
- SOPHIA: We're lucky
they didn't come sooner.

01:06:16.727 --> 01:06:19.527
- AMICIA: Yes, let's get out of here fast.

01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:44.735
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Through there.

01:06:46.714 --> 01:06:48.856
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Risky, but the water will help.

01:06:48.888 --> 01:06:50.253
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Let's try.

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.739
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
The water.

01:07:19.512 --> 01:07:22.412
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Careful, it's a big gap.

01:07:23.326 --> 01:07:26.782 line:20%
- VICTOR: May this putrid water
seal our determination.

01:07:26.463 --> 01:07:29.407 line:20%
- EMILIE: To stand by your side.
Day and night.

01:07:29.015 --> 01:07:31.082 line:20%
- VICTOR: I feel your sickness.

01:07:30.905 --> 01:07:32.772 line:20%
- EMILIE: I share your pain.

01:07:32.566 --> 01:07:34.566 line:20%
- VICTOR: We will protect you.

01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:36.336 line:20%
- EMILIE: We will care for you.

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:37.784 line:20%
- VICTOR: I am the Father.

01:07:38.251 --> 01:07:39.931 line:20%
I am waiting for you.

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:43.294 line:20%
- EMILIE: I am the Mother.
I am waiting for you.

01:07:43.342 --> 01:07:46.637 line:20%
Join us. Whenever you feel ready.

01:07:46.701 --> 01:07:47.701 line:20%
We are.

01:07:49.707 --> 01:07:52.405
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
How can stand in that water?

01:07:51.929 --> 01:07:54.516
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
They look so eager to have this child.

01:07:54.573 --> 01:07:56.459
It's sad they're so wrong.

01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:57.949
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Just like me.

01:07:58.143 --> 01:08:00.524
They still don't know they're wrong yet.

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:01.550
They'll be sad.

01:08:01.629 --> 01:08:04.486
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Hugo, these things you dreamt of...

01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.851
They existed.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.698
You just couldn't know
what they really meant.

01:08:08.397 --> 01:08:11.405
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) It meant
things would be easy and nice.

01:08:11.043 --> 01:08:13.265
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
It doesn't mean things won't get better.

01:08:12.995 --> 01:08:14.639
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Are you sure?

01:08:14.449 --> 01:08:17.259
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Your dream showed us another truth.

01:08:17.101 --> 01:08:19.253
But it is a truth.

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.044
We can still use it to change everything.

01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:23.893
- HUGO: Maybe.

01:08:34.258 --> 01:08:36.858
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
We're almost there.

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:51.128
That's... pretty unpleasant.

01:08:50.947 --> 01:08:53.248
- HUGO: I wish you could've seen my dream.

01:08:53.281 --> 01:08:55.347
At first it was a scary bird...

01:08:55.523 --> 01:08:57.379
You would've seen flowers.

01:08:57.428 --> 01:09:00.094
- AMICIA: Keep talking about it, please.

01:08:59.993 --> 01:09:02.127
- HUGO: The tree smelled so nice.

01:09:02.441 --> 01:09:04.370
It had branches like hair.

01:09:04.498 --> 01:09:06.018
It looked so gentle.

01:09:06.072 --> 01:09:07.352
- SOPHIA: Go on.

01:09:07.256 --> 01:09:08.936
- HUGO: And the water.

01:09:08.987 --> 01:09:11.453
It felt like it could clean anything.

01:09:12.572 --> 01:09:14.604
Not like this one.

01:09:15.704 --> 01:09:17.571
- AMICIA: That's nice, Hugo.

01:09:17.006 --> 01:09:18.686
- SOPHIA: Bloody nice.

01:09:22.975 --> 01:09:24.655
- AMICIA: We're there.

01:09:36.728 --> 01:09:37.728
That was...

01:09:39.227 --> 01:09:41.641
- SOPHIA: Spending a full week
at sea with my crew.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.893
Changes the notion of stench forever.

01:09:44.099 --> 01:09:46.299
- AMICIA: That was enough for me.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:49.097
Let's go to that fort.

01:09:50.238 --> 01:09:51.238
Hugo?

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:54.086
- HUGO: There was no fort in my dream.

01:09:54.972 --> 01:09:58.543
- AMICIA: Maybe... But your dream
put us in the right track.

01:09:58.672 --> 01:10:00.352
Look at all we've leant.

01:10:01.054 --> 01:10:03.588
Now we just have to find out the rest.

01:10:04.584 --> 01:10:07.725
- SOPHIA: Don't you want to know
what happened to that Aelia?

01:10:07.759 --> 01:10:09.834
And your... <i>"ancestor"</i>?

01:10:16.265 --> 01:10:18.598
- AMICIA: It's going to be alright.

01:10:25.327 --> 01:10:29.215
- HUGO: Erm... Can we take
these stinky clothes off now?

01:10:30.055 --> 01:10:31.735
- AMICIA: Yes, we should.
