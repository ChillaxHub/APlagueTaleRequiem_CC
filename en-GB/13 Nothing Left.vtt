Look at me... Please...

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:03.478
I need you.

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.728
- LUCAS: Amicia, we can't stay here.

00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:10.597

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.744

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.128

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.507
- AMICIA: To go where?

00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.761
- LUCAS: The harbour.

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:22.074
We're leaving this place.

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:26.996
- AMICIA: I want... rest.

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.314
- LUCAS: You can rest when you're safe.

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:35.321
- AMICIA: We will never be, Lucas. Never!

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:38.415
There can be no peace for us...

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:40.963
Look at him.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.488
- LUCAS: I'll lead the way.

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:50.138
Don't think, just follow me.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:54.408
I'll be your path,
for the both of you.

00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:58.152
I'll carry you if I must.

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:01.380
But I'm taking you out of here.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:09.293
Take a deep breath and stand up.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:13.567
You did it.

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:17.141
Come on, Hugo.

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.369
Good.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.090
I'm taking you out of here.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.542
- AMICIA: (GROANS)

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:07.555
- LUCAS: ... the arm?

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:09.731
- AMICIA: Shoulder.

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:12.707
- LUCAS: We have to fix it.

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:16.755
- AMICIA: Do it.

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:20.176
- LUCAS: Don't move.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.849
It's gonna hurt.

00:03:36.944 --> 00:03:38.224
Are you alright?

00:03:42.758 --> 00:03:43.758
Come on.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.760
Hugo.

00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:55.175
Let's go.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.974
- AMICIA: (GROANS) Breathe...

00:05:10.262 --> 00:05:12.595
- LUCAS: There has to be a way out.

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:19.349
Look! Up there! An opening!

00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:20.788
It's our way out.

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.032
- AMICIA: How do we...?

00:05:21.636 --> 00:05:24.781
- LUCAS: The upper floor.
There may be things up there we can use.

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:27.228
- AMICIA: I'll look. Stay with him.

00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:29.241
- LUCAS: Amicia, you're still hurt.

00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:30.724
- AMICIA: Try to bring him back.

00:05:30.654 --> 00:05:31.934
However you can.

00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:33.051
Please...

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:34.972
- LUCAS: Fine.

00:05:34.994 --> 00:05:36.674
But don't go too far.

00:06:39.247 --> 00:06:40.367
What a mess...

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:43.066
I can't...

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:48.695
(SOBBING) Oh... please...

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:53.033
Please... How am I going to do this?

00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:58.425
(SOBBING) Please.

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:01.226
(SOBBING) I can't...

00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:03.537
(SOBBING) Help me...

00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:06.269

(SNIFFS) Stand up!

00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:19.453
Stand up and go!

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:29.907
A pole with a rope...

(EFFORT GRUNTS)

00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:47.063

00:08:47.086 --> 00:08:50.736
(PANTING)

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.930
It's too high!

00:08:56.918 --> 00:08:59.452
- AMICIA: There's no other way, Lucas.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:06.245
- LUCAS: Amicia... Let's push.

00:09:07.302 --> 00:09:08.982
And see what's behind.

00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:38.948
- AMICIA: We saw those things
inside the Carrier's tomb.

00:09:41.744 --> 00:09:43.677
- HUGO: It will kill the sun.

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:45.684
- AMICIA: What?

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:50.551
- LUCAS: Sun Killer...

00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:52.924
The light Devourer.

00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:55.511
It's the Nebula,
the old texts talk about. It's real!

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.025
- HUGO: I'm home.

00:10:00.612 --> 00:10:02.612
- AMICIA: No! This isn't home!

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:04.699
Hugo, look at me!

00:10:05.763 --> 00:10:09.969
- LUCAS: It's not him, Amicia.
It's the Macula talking try to fill the void.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.709
Left by your mother's death.

00:10:13.852 --> 00:10:16.972
- AMICIA: I... I should've saved her... But...

00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:20.779
We can still finish this.

00:10:21.226 --> 00:10:22.586
You hear me Hugo?

00:10:23.585 --> 00:10:25.718
We can fight that bastard Count!

00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:27.133
And kill him!

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:28.966
- LUCAS: No, enough!

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.728
Amicia, we need to leave this damn ...
and take him away from here.

00:10:34.832 --> 00:10:37.810
He's drowning...
Amicia, focus!

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.870
You need to push back.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.072
Talk to him.
Keep him afloat.

00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:46.281
He needs you.

00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:49.323
Alright.

00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:51.291
Alright...

00:11:17.282 --> 00:11:18.562
Stay very close!

00:11:23.113 --> 00:11:26.646

Mind your torch!

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.300
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:11:30.742 --> 00:11:32.262

00:11:36.858 --> 00:11:39.081
- LUCAS: That's what I was talking about.
(COUGHS)

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:40.929
Stay away from those fumes.

00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:43.091
- AMICIA: (COUGHS) It's burnt!

00:11:50.891 --> 00:11:52.571
- AMICIA: I see them!

00:11:57.012 --> 00:11:58.372
- LUCAS: Careful!

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.924

This is... worse than anything...

00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:07.995

00:12:08.636 --> 00:12:09.836
- AMICIA: Ah...

00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:13.221
He knows we're here.

00:12:13.446 --> 00:12:15.126
- LUCAS: So what? Move!

00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:18.671
- AMICIA: I think... he's doing it.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.220
- LUCAS: What?

00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:25.293
- AMICIA: I felt his body... Spasm...
Right before it all burst.

00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:27.323
- LUCAS: I told you!

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:30.089
His bond with the Macula
is getting stronger.

00:12:30.365 --> 00:12:32.666
- AMICIA: I know you're still there, Hugo.

00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:33.278
Please, hold.

00:13:11.637 --> 00:13:12.637
Oh God!

00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:16.567
- LUCAS: Bloody hell!
We need to be more careful.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.073
- AMICIA: Lucas, there's...
something ahead.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.883
- LUCAS: I see it.
What the hell?

00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:31.682
It can't be...

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:34.442
- AMICIA: How many are there inside?

00:13:36.628 --> 00:13:38.849
- HUGO: Yes... I'm here.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.020

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.486

- HUGO: No!

00:13:46.286 --> 00:13:47.286
I'm staying!

00:13:47.763 --> 00:13:49.691
- AMICIA: There's nothing here for you!

00:13:49.136 --> 00:13:50.816
- HUGO: This is home!

00:13:50.993 --> 00:13:51.993
This is...

00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:54.786
- AMICIA: Stop! You're coming with me!

You hear me? He's coming with ME!

00:14:01.246 --> 00:14:04.150
- LUCAS: You made it so angry...

00:14:03.293 --> 00:14:05.516
They're coming... RUN!

00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:29.166
See?

00:15:30.476 --> 00:15:32.076
There's still light.

00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:56.033
Yes...

00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:57.283
That's our blood.

(MAIN THEME MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)

00:15:58.222 --> 00:15:59.222
That's you.

00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:18.589
We're not done yet.
We should go.

00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:22.011
- LUCAS: Yes. I'm ready.

00:16:22.988 --> 00:16:25.888
- AMICIA: We still have to reach the harbour.

00:16:53.681 --> 00:16:54.961
- LUCAS: Wait...

00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:56.626
The village...

00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:59.738
There's something wrong with the sea.

I did it.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.004
- AMICIA: No! The Count and Countess did.

00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:13.655
Let's go.

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:15.111

- SOLDIER 1: I can't believe
our Countess is dead.

00:26:04.027 --> 00:26:07.907
I heard the Count is so devastated
that he won't even be there for the hanging.

00:26:07.708 --> 00:26:10.379
They built a ... on the harbour's square for Arnaud.

Alright.

We need to reach the harbour anyway.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.794
We get Arnaud on the way
and we get off here.

00:26:38.337 --> 00:26:39.457

00:32:37.939 --> 00:32:39.672
Yes... Now where's Arnaud?

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.178
- HUGO: We must go faster.
They're going to kill him.

00:32:49.351 --> 00:32:51.081
- AMICIA: We're doing all we can.

00:32:50.732 --> 00:32:53.740
- HUGO: If they kill him,
I'll kill all of them!

00:32:54.273 --> 00:32:57.187
- AMICIA: You won't have to.
We'll get him out of there.

00:32:57.266 --> 00:32:58.466
And Sophia too.

00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:12.792
Come on, up.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.120
- HUGO: Alright.

00:33:29.238 --> 00:33:31.206
- AMICIA: Careful with the drop here.

00:33:30.714 --> 00:33:31.714
- HUGO: Yes.

00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:03.115
- AMICIA: Lord... Let's go.
We have to get closer.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.786
- LUCAS: So this is <i>the Arnaud</i>?

00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:06.369
The one they call in war?

00:34:06.817 --> 00:34:09.017
- HUGO: Yes. We have to save him.

00:34:09.851 --> 00:34:11.811
- AMICIA: Even if he doesn't deserve it.

00:34:11.637 --> 00:34:12.837
- LUCAS: I see.

00:34:13.267 --> 00:34:15.245
You've put together quite the troop.

00:34:19.383 --> 00:34:20.423
- AMICIA: Up.

00:34:20.948 --> 00:34:21.948
Climb up.

00:34:21.852 --> 00:34:23.052
- HUGO: Uh huh.

00:34:41.233 --> 00:34:42.513
- AMICIA: Quiet.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.990
Let's move closer.

00:34:53.911 --> 00:34:56.177
- HUGO: Now, Amicia. Do something!

00:34:56.673 --> 00:34:58.353
- AMICIA: Leave it to me.

00:40:05.964 --> 00:40:09.043
- ARNAUD: Watch out!
Heavy bastards are approaching!

00:40:10.147 --> 00:40:12.617
- AMICIA: Oh no...
Hugo! Stay here!

00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:15.159
- HUGO: Never!

00:40:24.987 --> 00:40:28.193
(PANTING)

00:40:28.418 --> 00:40:30.098
- ARNAUD: Bloody hell...

00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:33.421
- AMICIA: It's over now.

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:34.749
- LUCAS: We did it, Hugo.

00:40:34.872 --> 00:40:35.992
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:40:36.206 --> 00:40:37.206
Breathe...

00:40:37.396 --> 00:40:38.516
Calm down now.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.840
Let's free Arnaud, right?

00:40:40.684 --> 00:40:42.417
- ARNAUD: Yes... please...

00:40:54.506 --> 00:40:55.946
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:41:08.501 --> 00:41:10.501
- LUCAS: Hugo said it was his.

00:41:32.521 --> 00:41:33.881
- AMICIA: Sophia!

00:41:36.564 --> 00:41:39.572
- SOPHIA: You took your sweet time!
Come aboard.

00:41:42.307 --> 00:41:43.987
Go collapse somewhere.

00:41:45.678 --> 00:41:46.678
Wait.

00:41:47.265 --> 00:41:48.545
And your mother?

00:41:49.643 --> 00:41:51.509
- HUGO: She won't come back.

00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:55.042
- AMICIA: We must go. Now.

00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:59.039
- SOPHIA: I see... I'll take it from here.

00:41:59.425 --> 00:42:00.425
You. Come.

00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.224
- HUGO: She's never coming back.

00:42:09.805 --> 00:42:11.165
- AMICIA: I know.

00:42:13.384 --> 00:42:15.584
- HUGO: I-I wanted to tell her...

00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:17.634
... a lot of things.

00:42:18.111 --> 00:42:19.471
- AMICIA: Me too.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.040
But she knew.

00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:23.591
Everything... already.

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:27.999
You're her greatest gift.

00:42:29.337 --> 00:42:31.337
She loved you the way you are.

00:42:31.735 --> 00:42:33.415
The way she made you.

00:42:40.355 --> 00:42:41.395
We will live.

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:44.687
And we will heal.

00:42:50.018 --> 00:42:51.018
The scars...

00:42:52.943 --> 00:42:55.476
We keep them, so that we don't forget,

00:42:56.835 --> 00:42:58.515
So that we can accept.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.610
Until they don't hurt anymore.
