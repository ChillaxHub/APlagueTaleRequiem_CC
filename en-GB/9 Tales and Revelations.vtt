- SOPHIA: What order?

00:18:57.185 --> 00:19:00.085
- AMICIA: A very ancient Order of Alchemist.

00:19:00.756 --> 00:19:03.724
You overheard us on the boat, Sophia...

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:04.797
Hugo is sick.

It's not contagious.

00:19:59.689 --> 00:20:01.369

00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:03.443
- AMICIA: It makes sense.

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:06.519
Let's go visit those Mothers then.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.790

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.230

- SOPHIA: Sanctuary.
That's what I've heard it called.

00:20:52.343 --> 00:20:54.438
And now I'm even more curious about it.

00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:29.955
- SOPHIA: So we've got a magic bird...

00:21:29.686 --> 00:21:31.819
An ancient Order of Alchemist...

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.177
The little one has visions...

00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:36.526

What else can I expect?

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:39.067

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.131
...special.

00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:45.082
Our Mother is an alchemist
but she couldn't do anything about it.

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:46.842
It's almost like...

00:21:47.196 --> 00:21:48.196
A curse.

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.521
- SOPHIA: Who could curse such a cute baby?

00:21:50.347 --> 00:21:52.027
- HUGO: I'm not a baby!

00:21:51.903 --> 00:21:53.837
- AMICIA: It's the bloodline.

00:21:54.248 --> 00:21:56.391
This thing goes back to...

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:58.595
...the dawn of times.

00:21:58.502 --> 00:22:00.022
It's unfair, but...

00:22:01.168 --> 00:22:02.848
This is real, Sophia.

00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:06.585
In Guyenne, the Inquisition came after us over this.

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.605
We barely made it here.

00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:10.208
- HUGO: It was horrible.

00:22:10.723 --> 00:22:12.403
They killed everybody.

00:22:12.304 --> 00:22:14.177
- SOPHIA: Damn...
Alright.

00:22:14.304 --> 00:22:17.248
We'll find what you came for.
You have my word.

00:22:16.765 --> 00:22:18.365
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:22:47.147 --> 00:22:49.614
That's it. The path to the sanctuary.

00:22:49.274 --> 00:22:51.305
- SOPHIA: So we're done here for now?

00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:53.154
- AMICIA: Yes, let's go.

00:22:56.296 --> 00:22:58.096
It's gonna be quite a walk.

00:22:57.645 --> 00:22:58.931
- HUGO: First to the top!

00:22:58.614 --> 00:23:01.514
- AMICIA: Hey, easy! I don't wanna carry you!

00:23:01.837 --> 00:23:03.117

Are you tired? We've been walking a while.

00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:33.239

00:24:33.956 --> 00:24:37.066

We're not there yet.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.189
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS) Looks like
someone is more tired than you.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.164

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:44.186
Everything I need is at sea level.

00:24:44.312 --> 00:24:45.992
- HUGO: I like mountains.

00:24:45.662 --> 00:24:48.371
They're big and tall
so when you're on top of it...

00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:49.941
You're big and tall too.

00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:52.343
- AMICIA: You know,
it's his first time climbing one.

00:24:52.418 --> 00:24:56.258

let's be big and tall together.

00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:05.345
Damn, it's getting hot.

00:25:05.425 --> 00:25:08.325

00:25:08.499 --> 00:25:10.530

00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:14.867
- AMICIA: Come on. It'll be worth the sweat.
Look at the size of it.

00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:40.003
- SOPHIA: So what do you expect
to find up there?

00:25:39.577 --> 00:25:41.977
- HUGO: I want to see the real bird.

00:25:41.849 --> 00:25:42.849
The tree...

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.008
Or the pond!

00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:46.190
- AMICIA: I prefer an elixir.

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:48.628
Something to really help you, Hugo.

00:25:48.423 --> 00:25:50.281
- HUGO: Maybe the bird will have it.

00:25:50.377 --> 00:25:52.503
Oh, it's spring water.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.590
- SOPHIA: How can you run in this heat?

00:25:54.943 --> 00:25:56.623
- AMICIA: Child's skill.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.916
He can also fall asleep in a snap.

00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:05.268
Hm... It looks so fresh.

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:06.629
- HUGO: It is.

00:26:07.027 --> 00:26:08.964
- SOPHIA: Just what I need anyway.

00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:09.675

00:26:09.186 --> 00:26:11.319
You have some dirt on your face.

00:26:10.806 --> 00:26:12.806
- SOPHIA: I'll get it for you.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:14.048
- HUGO: Ah... (LAUGHS)

00:26:14.128 --> 00:26:16.191
Water attack!!!!!

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.000

(LAUGHTERS)

00:26:21.158 --> 00:26:22.676

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:24.806
I yield. You soaked me to death.

00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:26.631

00:26:38.677 --> 00:26:40.264

00:26:40.093 --> 00:26:41.826

00:26:41.373 --> 00:26:43.573

00:45:38.756 --> 00:45:40.823

00:45:41.584 --> 00:45:44.251
Today marks the longest day of the year.
