III - A BURDEN OF BLOOD

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:41.430
- AMICIA:
(FRUSTRATINGLY EXHALES)

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:44.255
- BÉATRICE: Lucas.
Come, right now.

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:45.233
- LUCAS: Coming!

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:46.622
- AMICIA: I heard Hugo crying.
What's going on?

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:49.154
- BÉATRICE: He didn't react well.
He's having a seizure.

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:50.352
- AMICIA: What? Mother!

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:51.781
You must stop this!

00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:53.508
We don't know this man!

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.515
- BÉATRICE: Amicia!
This sort of thing was always likely.

00:00:55.578 --> 00:01:00.781
And <i>this man</i> is an exalted member
of <i>the</i> most ancient college of alchemists that exists.

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:02.859
The Order <i>knows</i> the Macula.

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:05.515
Hugo's not alone.
I'm here.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.571
We need nightshade
as soon as possible to calm the tremors.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:13.609
There is a herbalist
in the outskirt of the city.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:17.437
It's at the other end of the butcher's district
at the edge of the forest.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.469
You'll see.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.629
- LUCAS: Of course.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.187
- AMICIA: I'm coming.

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:22.203
I feel useless here anyway.

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.812
(RAIN SOUND)

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.315
(DOOR SHUTS HEAVILY)

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:46.890
(RAIN SOUND)

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.489
- LUCAS: Foul rain!

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.321
We have a long way to go.

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:52.133
Let's not waste time.

00:01:52.203 --> 00:02:17.734
(RAIN SOUND)

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:20.137
- AMICIA: Things are getting
worse and worse.

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:21.234
- LUCAS: I know you're worried.

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:24.241
But you should give
Magister Vaudin some time.

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:25.014
- AMICIA: Time??

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:25.625
To do <i>what</i>??

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:27.499
Make Hugo feel even worse?

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.312
- LUCAS: He's conducting tests.

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:31.024
He knows what he's doing.

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:33.236
He's the most competent in his domain.

00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:36.875
- AMICIA: Urghh... Enough of that!
He's been treating my brother like an animal!

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.219
No!

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:39.414
We need another solution.

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:40.844
Like...

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.878
This island Hugo dreams of.

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:44.614
- LUCAS: A dream...

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.775
What can we do with a dream, Amicia?

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.829
- AMICIA: Just...

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.450
...keep caring about him, please!

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:51.827
- LUCAS: I care!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.164
But it's not enough anymore.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:03:04.187
(RAIN SOUND)

00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:06.113
- AMICIA: Everybody's gone.

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:25.968
(RAIN SOUND)

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.474
- LUCAS: I think it's through here.

00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:32.307
- MAN: I can't believe
they've blocked the way to the arena.

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.494
- WOMAN: What's happened down there?

00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.968
- LUCAS: Alright.
Our gate should be over there.

00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:36.945
- AMICIA: Oh... It stinks...

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.937
- LUCAS: Well...
That means we're on the right path.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:40.953
There it is.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:49.546
Alright, you're ready?

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.477
- AMICIA: Yes. Let's go.

00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:32.172
Urghh...

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:34.966
Rotten flesh...

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.031
- LUCAS: Yes.
It's the butcher's district.

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:40.596
It's the shortest way
to the herbalist.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.967
- MAN 1: Come on, good people!

00:04:43.344 --> 00:04:46.480
I've got all the poultry
that you could ever want.

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:47.754
- MAN 2: Pork pork!

00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:49.359
To roast, to boil!

00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:51.191
Tastiest meat in the world!

00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:53.724
- MAN 3: If you never tried beef,
you don't know what you're missing!

00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:53.461
- AMICIA: Looks tasty for sure.

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:57.348
- LUCAS: There's the city gate.

00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:58.250
- AMICIA: We're not there yet.

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:00.883
And Hugo might even be
getting worse right now.

00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:01.313
Let's hurry!

00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:03.070
- LUCAS: It will be alright.

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:18.390
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.164
- AMICIA: What's this?

00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:21.555
- LUCAS: Nothing good, it seems.

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:25.343 line:20%
- GUARD: This district is now closed
on the authority of the Count Victor of Arles.

00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:28.921 line:20%
For your own safety,
do not try to get inside.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.886 line:20%
- MAN: You can't keep us out!

00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:32.765
- AMICIA: No! Hugo can't wait!

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:35.459
- LUCAS: There might be another way in.

00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.815 line:20%
- MAN: (SHOUTS) Tell us what happened!

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:38.416
- WOMAN 1: My children are in there!

00:05:37.547 --> 00:05:40.214
- WOMAN 2: We know something's going on!

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.005
- MAN: What are you hiding from us?

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:42.977
- WOMAN: Did people die?

00:05:42.657 --> 00:05:44.924
- MAN: Where do you want us to go?

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.656
- LUCAS: Hey, there's a back alley
through there.

00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:52.128
What do you think?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500
- AMICIA: Do you see a way in?

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:54.292
- LUCAS: Wait.

00:05:57.422 --> 00:05:58.422
I think...

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.391
Yes...

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:07.289
Through here, Amicia.

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.399
- AMICIA: It looks safe.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.750
- LUCAS: Is it someone's home?

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:15.043
- AMICIA: We're just passing.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.242
Urghh... You must be joking!

00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:20.148
- LUCAS: The butcher's dump!

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.993
We're going in there?

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:27.166
- AMICIA: Don't think.
Just hold your breath.

00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:29.703
No...

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.399
- LUCAS: No no no no no! Urgh!

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:37.031
(COUGHS)

00:06:37.078 --> 00:06:39.145
- AMICIA: Ugh... Don't tell me.

00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:39.821
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:41.910
I've got something in my mouth.

00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:43.689
- AMICIA: I said hold your breath!

00:06:43.094 --> 00:06:44.694
- LUCAS: I panicked!

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:46.379
- AMICIA: Oh Lucas!

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:51.349
- LUCAS: All the living things...
That must be... born from this...

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:54.658
- AMICIA: Why in the world
would you think about that!

00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:55.804
- LUCAS: It stops me from...

00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:57.174
...losing my mind.

00:06:57.078 --> 00:07:00.150
- AMICIA: But it takes me closer to losing mine!

00:06:59.563 --> 00:07:02.163
- LUCAS: Just think of it as matter...

00:07:01.953 --> 00:07:03.553
Being transformed...

00:07:07.438 --> 00:07:08.878
- AMICIA: Oh Lord!

00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:12.215
- LUCAS: My boots are ruined!

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:15.555
- AMICIA: Like the arena.

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:17.645
This whole place is just bait.

00:07:30.109 --> 00:07:31.843
There's a cart in the way.

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:34.024
We have to keep going.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.143
Help me with this.

00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:35.821
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:38.739
- AMICIA: Wait, no!

00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:41.843
(COUGHS)

00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:43.109
What is that?

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:48.937
Oh no! NO!
Not them! Not again!

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.702
- LUCAS: We're going to need fire. Quick!

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:53.069
- AMICIA: I knew it!

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:54.108
They're already spreading.

00:07:53.734 --> 00:07:56.401
Now we'll have to go through them again!

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:59.740
- LUCAS: We can do it.
Just stay focused on getting the nightshade.

00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:00.633
- AMICIA: Yes... Yes.

00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:17.864
(DISTANT SCREAMING)

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.805
- LUCAS: You hear that?

00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:20.324
There're still people around!

00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:23.859
- AMICIA: They didn't evacuate the district!
It's like in the arena.

00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:31.928
- LUCAS: The fire won't be
bright enough to let us cross.

00:08:35.688 --> 00:08:37.368
They came for the meat.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:44.742
- AMICIA: They need to move.

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:47.197
- LUCAS: They want that
hanging carcass, right?

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.590
- AMICIA: Of course, they do.

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:52.746
- LUCAS: They can't reach it.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.031
That bag.

00:08:53.484 --> 00:08:55.484
It's like the one in the cart.

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:57.176
Try hitting it with your sling.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.605
- AMICIA: What's that powder?

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:02.426
- LUCAS: Saltpetre.

00:09:02.656 --> 00:09:06.765
It normally preserves meat
but it's thick enough to choke the flames.

00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.448
- AMICIA: This is more saltpetre, right?

00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:10.484
- LUCAS: Yes. A lot of it.

00:09:10.578 --> 00:09:13.203
- AMICIA: If the people outside
knew what's happening...

00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:15.205
They have family here... Children...

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.822
- LUCAS: There's no way
the army can hide that.

00:09:16.938 --> 00:09:19.071
- AMICIA: Lord... it's infested.

00:09:19.878 --> 00:09:21.558 line:20%
- WOMAN: Let's leave now!

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:23.099 line:20%
- MAN: Wait... The light!

00:09:22.671 --> 00:09:24.271
- LUCAS: Townsfolks?

00:09:25.196 --> 00:09:27.745
- AMICIA: That's close enough.
Come. Don't stay there.

00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:29.895
- LUCAS: Wait, I'm taking some.

00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:31.227
This stuff is too useful.

00:09:31.828 --> 00:09:33.906
Alright. It's all yours now.

00:09:34.078 --> 00:09:36.145
- AMICIA: I have it. Stay back.

00:09:38.859 --> 00:09:39.899
Now the fire.

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:41.156
Yes.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.117
That's it. Let's keep going.

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:51.852
- LUCAS: Yes. Well done.

00:09:56.188 --> 00:09:59.324
I really hope we find our herbalist
in this mess.

00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:01.241
- AMICIA: He's outside the city, right?

00:10:00.547 --> 00:10:02.067
So maybe he's safe.

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:19.287 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Three more down here.
They didn't let go easily.

00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:21.044
- LUCAS: Oh no! A soldier!

00:10:20.969 --> 00:10:22.169 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Hey!

00:10:22.031 --> 00:10:23.711 line:20%
What are you doing here?

00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:25.313
- AMICIA: We're... just crossing.

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:27.978 line:20%
- SOLDIER: No one gets out.
Those are the orders.

00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:29.083
- AMICIA: Wait, no!

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.828 line:20%
- SOLDIER: You should be dead!

00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:31.965
- LUCAS: He's going to throw! Amicia!

00:10:34.547 --> 00:10:35.987
- AMICIA: Oh Lord!

00:10:36.266 --> 00:10:37.706
That was so close.

00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:39.500
- LUCAS: You've just...

00:10:39.547 --> 00:10:42.447
...killed a soldier of the Army of Provence.

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:44.734
- AMICIA: I know!
Why did he attack us?

00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:52.011
- LUCAS: Look!

00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:54.238
They're killing townsfolks.

00:10:54.828 --> 00:10:56.617
- AMICIA: They're purging the districts now.

00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:59.441
- SOLDIER: Hey!
Come back here you bastard!

00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:02.862
Bloody hell!

00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:05.609
Urgh... You won't get further.

00:11:05.953 --> 00:11:08.220
Goddamn biters kill faster than us.

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:10.740
- LUCAS: He'll execute us on sight.

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:13.210
- AMICIA: It's us or them now.
Hugo can't wait.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:14.558
We need that nightshade fast.

- LUCAS: I guess you're right.

00:11:16.797 --> 00:11:17.797
Listen...

00:11:18.188 --> 00:11:20.854
You can use that saltpetre against them.

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:22.985
Take this to craft some Extinguis.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:24.867
It should be enough
to put out that torch.

00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:26.891
- AMICIA: Extinguis. Alright.

00:11:29.172 --> 00:11:30.172
Done.

00:11:30.797 --> 00:11:33.197
- LUCAS: Now shoot it to that torch.

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:33.766

Well, it... worked.

00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:46.381
- AMICIA: We did it in the past, but...

00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:47.108
...it's still...

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.850
- LUCAS: Disturbing.

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:49.526
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:51.784
I may have to use it again.

00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:54.514

00:12:10.687 --> 00:12:13.087

- AMICIA: No time to cry over them.
Hugo's waiting.

00:12:17.734 --> 00:12:21.894
- SOLDIER: Rememer to mark the houses
you've cleared with a cross.

00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:24.882
It's imperative that the bodies
are taken out of the city.

00:12:24.594 --> 00:12:28.306
- AMICIA: Sure, take the bodies out.
That rats will follow.

00:12:27.406 --> 00:12:29.740
- LUCAS: How can they be so stupid!

00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:41.234
- SOLDIER: I think I heard something.

00:12:50.609 --> 00:12:54.385
- AMICIA: We must leave this city.
Leave this Vaudin behind.

00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:55.765
- LUCAS: For what, Amicia?

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.321
A dream of an island?

00:12:57.203 --> 00:13:00.103
- AMICIA: A dream
he's been having for weeks.

00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:31.258
That's the city gate.

Stay in the light at all cost!

00:13:35.844 --> 00:13:38.244

00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:39.999
Our herbalist's out there.

00:13:39.703 --> 00:13:43.756
- AMICIA: Don't tell me they're also
purging the outskirts! Goddammit!

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:47.023
- LUCAS: Hey... Hey...
We can still reach him before them.

00:13:47.047 --> 00:13:48.727
- AMICIA: It never ends.

00:14:01.172 --> 00:14:04.515

if I found a workbench.

00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:19.274 line:20%
That explains the carnage.

00:14:19.306 --> 00:14:20.986 line:20%
The man's a dog of war.

00:14:21.063 --> 00:14:22.743
- AMICIA: Two torches.

00:14:22.234 --> 00:14:23.796
- LUCAS: Your jar.

00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:26.511
A cloud of Extinguis
will put out several torches.

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:28.199
- AMICIA: A jar of Extinguis?

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.030
That could work.

00:14:40.719 --> 00:14:44.367
- AMICIA: They've wasted
enough of our time already. Come.

00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:46.166
- LUCAS: They closed the portcullis.

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:48.367
- AMICIA: There must be a way
to open it again.

00:15:05.859 --> 00:15:07.539
I hope Hugo's holding on.

00:15:07.609 --> 00:15:09.476
- LUCAS: I hate to say it...

00:15:09.063 --> 00:15:10.743
But he's survived worse.

00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:12.331

00:15:18.219 --> 00:15:20.219
We're going to have a problem.

00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:20.776
- LUCAS: What?

00:15:20.813 --> 00:15:23.506
- AMICIA: There's no brake on this thing.
So we'll have to run.

00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:27.753
That's it.
Release on my go.

00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:30.063
Now! Go!

00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:31.702

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.499

Yes...

00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:45.899
- LUCAS: We're here...

00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:46.781
Good work.

00:15:49.422 --> 00:15:50.622
- AMICIA: Look.

00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:51.938
No rats.

00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:54.936
- LUCAS: So it stopped at the city walls.

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:57.069
- AMICIA: (SCOFFS)
They don't care about walls.

00:15:56.203 --> 00:15:57.883
They care about food.

00:15:57.594 --> 00:16:00.327

00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:02.155
- AMICIA: Hey...

00:16:02.516 --> 00:16:04.196
I've just remembered.

00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:06.149
In Vaudin's laboratory...

00:16:06.188 --> 00:16:09.054
Th-there was a fresco
with an island on it.

00:16:09.078 --> 00:16:10.358
I saw it, Lucas!

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.775
What about that?
Vaudin must know about it.

00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:15.742

00:16:15.563 --> 00:16:16.563
I'll...

00:16:16.406 --> 00:16:17.526
...try to ask.

00:16:17.594 --> 00:16:19.194
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:24.859
Now... Mother said the herbalist lives
at the edge of the forest. We should be close.

00:16:24.703 --> 00:16:26.383
- LUCAS: It's so quiet.

00:16:25.922 --> 00:16:27.602
- AMICIA: It feels off.

00:16:28.063 --> 00:16:30.663
There were people here
not too long ago.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.903
Someone used that forge recently.

00:16:37.531 --> 00:16:40.198
- LUCAS: Hey...
There's a workbench here.

00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:42.157
You can improve your gear with it.

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.668
Just take a look right now...

00:16:43.344 --> 00:16:45.277

00:16:55.922 --> 00:16:57.722
That's better.
That'll help.

00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:00.890

00:17:00.234 --> 00:17:01.914

00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:03.570

They're here. They're here too.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)
This is going nowhere...

00:22:55.384 --> 00:22:56.664
- LUCAS: Wait...

00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:57.965
- AMICIA: And now
I'm not even there for him.

00:22:57.854 --> 00:22:59.588
How will we even get back?

00:22:59.438 --> 00:23:02.708
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Hands are sweaty...

00:23:02.884 --> 00:23:05.350
- SOLDIER: Look for anybody hiding.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.520
- SOLDIER: You, stay here and patrol.
Report if you see one bloody rat.

00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:17.375
The others are with me.
Look for any valuables.

00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:19.149
We need food, drugs, any goods.

00:23:19.321 --> 00:23:20.441
- LUCAS: No...

00:23:21.212 --> 00:23:22.572
They're going in.

00:23:23.524 --> 00:23:24.644
What do we do?

00:23:25.743 --> 00:23:26.743
Hey?

00:23:27.353 --> 00:23:28.553
- AMICIA: What?

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:30.625
- LUCAS: You're not alright.

00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:31.068
- AMICIA: I am.

00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:32.579
- LUCAS: No, you're not.

00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:34.983
You're not even
breathing right now.

00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:37.296
- AMICIA: I'm dizzy.

00:23:37.524 --> 00:23:39.124
My heart is pouding.

00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:44.449
- LUCAS: Listen...

00:23:44.228 --> 00:23:47.055
The Count's soldiers
are gonna seize everything.

00:23:47.087 --> 00:23:50.031
We've got to get
the nightshade before they do.

00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:52.149
I have to.

00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:53.221
- AMICIA: No!

00:23:54.056 --> 00:23:56.656
- LUCAS: You're in no state to do this.

00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:59.711
I'm going. I'll sneak in.
I can do it.

00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:04.392
- AMICIA: If anything...

00:24:03.759 --> 00:24:05.359
- LUCAS: I will run.

00:24:05.556 --> 00:24:07.236
It's not my first time.

00:24:19.228 --> 00:24:21.361
- AMICIA: What is wrong with me?

00:24:21.524 --> 00:24:30.399
(HEAVY BREATHING)

00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:57.993
- LUCAS: No! Let me go!

00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:59.790
- AMICIA: Oh no! I knew it!

00:25:00.243 --> 00:25:01.508
I knew it.

00:25:02.931 --> 00:25:03.931
Alright...

00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:05.601
Move... quick...

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:06.946
(EXHALES)

00:25:07.228 --> 00:25:08.228
Come on.

00:25:15.462 --> 00:25:19.046
- SOLDIER 1: Attention!
We've just got a looter over there.

00:25:18.868 --> 00:25:22.883
There're maybe others.
Search the area and kill on sight.

00:25:22.931 --> 00:25:25.071
- SOLDIER 2: Understood.
Spread out, men.

00:25:25.118 --> 00:25:26.415
Be careful!

00:25:27.176 --> 00:25:29.794
- AMICIA: Stupid! Why did you
let him go by himself!

00:25:28.303 --> 00:25:29.503
- LUCAS: Ahh...

00:25:29.557 --> 00:25:31.493
Lucas... He's alive!

00:25:31.954 --> 00:25:33.954
Bastards! When I get to you...

00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:08.133
Get Lucas, get the nightshade, and get out.
Kill whoever tries to stop you.

00:26:53.899 --> 00:26:55.579
This is all your fault!

00:26:55.618 --> 00:26:57.058
Now make it right!

00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:18.017
- SOLDIER: This area is secured.

00:27:23.395 --> 00:27:25.095
Wait... There they are!

00:27:25.462 --> 00:27:27.142
Don't let them get away!

00:27:42.204 --> 00:27:45.788
They disappeared into the grass.
I'm going after them.

00:27:48.954 --> 00:27:50.984
Spread out and get that bastard!

00:28:48.996 --> 00:28:50.965
- AMICIA: That's it.
That's the way to do it.

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.337 position:20% line:20%
- LUCAS: Ah... Stop!

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.718
- AMICIA: Hang in there, Lucas.
I'm here... I'll make them pay!

00:29:42.297 --> 00:29:44.697
- SOLDIER: Speak boy,
who's with you?

00:29:44.047 --> 00:29:45.247
- LUCAS: Ahhhh!

00:29:47.908 --> 00:29:49.987
(LOUD DOOR KNOCKING SOUND)

00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:53.508
- AMICIA: Did they hurt you?

00:29:53.235 --> 00:29:55.501
- LUCAS: I'll... survive...

00:29:55.547 --> 00:29:56.547
Thanks.

00:29:57.485 --> 00:30:00.719
- AMICIA: This one learned his lesson,
mangy dogs.

00:30:00.813 --> 00:30:05.250
- LUCAS: Hey, forget about him.
I found the nightshade. We have to go now.

00:30:05.344 --> 00:30:06.598
- SOLDIER: I heard shout in the barn!

00:30:06.407 --> 00:30:09.671
- AMICIA: They're coming.
Go hide. I'll handle them.

00:30:09.157 --> 00:30:12.485
- LUCAS: No, we've got what we need.
Let's leave now!

00:30:12.282 --> 00:30:16.186
- AMICIA: No, they'll come after us
and I'm done running away.

00:30:15.688 --> 00:30:19.016
- SOLDIER: Man down!
We've got intruders here. Alert!

00:30:18.891 --> 00:30:21.624
- AMICIA: That's it.
Come. I'm right here.

00:30:23.719 --> 00:30:24.891
There you go.

00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:29.275
See? There's nothing.
Nothing to be scared of.

00:30:29.297 --> 00:30:32.497
- LUCAS: Amicia, what are you doing?
We have to go!

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.667
- AMICIA: No! I'm tired of being afraid.

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:36.665
I'll show them that it's over...

00:30:36.938 --> 00:30:39.312
- AMICIA: Come.
I'll give you what you want.

00:30:39.047 --> 00:30:41.247
- LUCAS: He has a shield.
Careful.

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:43.451
- SOLDIER: Intruder here.
She's armed.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.508
- LUCAS: Shoot the bag, Amicia.
It'll blind him.

00:30:49.063 --> 00:30:50.583
- AMICIA: Yes, yes!

00:30:51.438 --> 00:30:53.118
How'd you like that, huh?

00:30:52.766 --> 00:30:54.446
When someone fights back?

00:30:54.344 --> 00:30:57.937
- LUCAS: There're too many!
They'll keep coming if we don't go!

00:30:57.656 --> 00:31:00.664
- AMICIA: Go if you want!
This is my ground now!

00:31:00.406 --> 00:31:02.086
This is where they die.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.922
Oh yes, come then.
Show me how you do it.

00:31:10.016 --> 00:31:12.437
That's some (good God).
Come on!!

00:31:12.735 --> 00:31:15.468
- LUCAS: You have to stop!
We'll die here.

00:31:33.828 --> 00:31:36.062
Yes, come. Come try!

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:39.625
Look, this is how it works now.
<i>I</i> said the rules!

00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.158
- THE BEAST: I'll teach you to kill my men.

00:32:06.276 --> 00:32:08.676
Don't think we're done with you yet.

00:32:12.047 --> 00:32:13.047
(DOOR SHUTS)

00:32:26.703 --> 00:32:29.765
- THE BEAST: Don't expect
to quit death after what you've done.

00:32:29.906 --> 00:32:34.843
We've paid the executioner to spend
a bit of time with you before you hang.

00:32:40.313 --> 00:32:42.313
- AMICIA: You should sit down.

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:45.525
- LUCAS: After that,
it's all you have to say?

00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:47.875
Come on.

00:32:48.656 --> 00:32:50.281
You could do better than that!

00:32:50.313 --> 00:32:53.703
You have a whole garrison here.
What're you really let yourself go.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.060
- AMICIA: Stop!

00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:54.781
- LUCAS: No!

00:32:55.453 --> 00:32:57.720
Do you see the situation we're in?

00:32:58.188 --> 00:33:00.321
We were just about to get herbs.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.937
How do you think Hugo
through right now without them?

00:33:02.985 --> 00:33:05.718
How would he feel
when his sister's hanging?

00:33:04.313 --> 00:33:06.113
- AMICIA: I made a mistake!

00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:07.141
Alright?

00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:12.898
I don't know what's happening to me, Lucas.

00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:17.531
I... I feel my mind going...

00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:24.257
- LUCAS: Yes... Because this world hurts...

00:33:25.265 --> 00:33:26.915
And it keeps hurting.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.293
And you want to hurt it back.

00:33:30.172 --> 00:33:32.839
But it's a fight you cannot win, Amicia.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.110
You are not them.

00:33:38.547 --> 00:33:39.987
You are a De Rune.

00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:45.091
- SOLDIER: Hey!

00:33:45.473 --> 00:33:48.673
The gallows is almost ready.
Prepare the condemned.

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:51.894
- LUCAS: That's us. Listen.

00:33:52.672 --> 00:33:54.472
This thing works with fire.

00:33:54.391 --> 00:33:56.324
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:03.948
- THE BEAST: Get out.
Your ... is awaiting.

00:34:07.953 --> 00:34:09.703
- LUCAS: I'm ready.
Tell me when.

00:34:09.828 --> 00:34:12.968
- THE BEAST: Stop there.
We'll wait for the executioner.

00:34:13.016 --> 00:34:15.349
He must be finishing one right now.

00:34:15.435 --> 00:34:16.864
- LUCAS: Amicia, we have to hurry...

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.870
- AMICIA: Now!

00:34:19.063 --> 00:34:20.468
(COUGHS) Lucas!

00:34:20.514 --> 00:34:23.114
- LUCAS: The stairs. Run!
It won't last.

00:34:25.578 --> 00:34:27.258
- AMICIA: What was that?

00:34:26.547 --> 00:34:28.312
- LUCAS: I call it Stupefacio

00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.055
You'll get used to it.

00:34:29.438 --> 00:34:31.125
- AMICIA: That was (COUGHS) efficient.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.286
Ah... they still have my sling.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.286
- LUCAS: Now it's not the time.

00:34:37.766 --> 00:34:41.218
- AMICIA: That will slow them down.
You saved our skin down there.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.250
- LUCAS: Yes... Yes...
Where to now?

00:34:44.485 --> 00:34:47.685
- AMICIA: There should be a walkway...
Or a roof...

00:34:47.766 --> 00:34:49.899
- LUCAS: There's a window there.

00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:53.203
- AMICIA: It overlooks the roof, Lucas.
No choice... (GASPS)

00:34:53.313 --> 00:34:54.753
Lord, that's high.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.069
- LUCAS: Is it safe?

00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:57.665
- AMICIA: Sort of. Come.

00:34:59.813 --> 00:35:02.949
- LUCAS: Oh wow...
This is really not safe at all.

00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:05.453
- AMICIA: Shhh...
Calm down. Come.

00:35:12.703 --> 00:35:15.370
I think... it's the only way out of her.

00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:16.961
- LUCAS: Are you joking?

00:35:16.485 --> 00:35:18.951
- AMICIA: No, just stick to the wall.

00:35:19.422 --> 00:35:22.022
- LUCAS: No please... Please, please...

00:35:22.047 --> 00:35:23.847
- AMICIA: You can... do it!

00:35:24.688 --> 00:35:28.047
Sorry to put you through this.
This is my fault.

00:35:28.266 --> 00:35:31.922
- LUCAS: I... honestly...
don't care right now...

00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:35.057
- AMICIA: There's another roof...
Almost there...

00:35:40.516 --> 00:35:41.516
I did it!

00:35:41.563 --> 00:35:43.547
(SIGHS OF RELIEF)

00:35:44.016 --> 00:35:46.765
- LUCAS: Let's get off this roof. Please.

00:35:50.656 --> 00:35:54.687
- AMICIA: Guard. I can't do anything.
Let's pass it, quietly.

00:35:59.438 --> 00:36:00.438
Here.

00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:02.848
- SOLDIER 1: What is it?
More requisitions?

00:36:03.033 --> 00:36:05.566
- SOLDIER 2: Uh huh.
From the outskirts.

00:36:05.223 --> 00:36:06.903
Butcher's district gate.

00:36:06.827 --> 00:36:08.267
- SOLDIER 1: Ah...

00:36:07.923 --> 00:36:10.867
You're the ones
who met that crazy girl, right?

00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:13.482
- SOLDIER 2: That bloody witch
and her sling.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.940
But the Beast got her.

00:36:15.025 --> 00:36:17.351
We've got enough meat
to hold out for a week.

00:36:17.415 --> 00:36:19.095
- SOLDIER 1: Nice work.

00:36:18.727 --> 00:36:20.407
Get to the depot fast.

00:36:20.696 --> 00:36:22.696
The girl is to be hanged soon.

00:36:22.571 --> 00:36:24.305
There'll be quite a crowd.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.990
- SOLDIER 2: I'll be there.

00:36:25.787 --> 00:36:26.820
- AMICIA: Count on that!

00:36:26.844 --> 00:36:28.644
- LUCAS: That cart, Amicia.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.360
The nightshade might be in it.

00:36:29.953 --> 00:36:31.633
Maybe your sling too.

00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:33.201
- AMICIA: We can't take the risk.

00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:35.141
Hugo needs us.
We'll do without.

00:36:35.217 --> 00:36:36.179
- LUCAS: It's wiser, yes.

00:36:36.203 --> 00:36:37.883
- AMICIA: Another guard.

00:36:40.563 --> 00:36:42.243
- LUCAS: He won't move.

00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:45.500
- AMICIA: But there's a fire.
Do you still have some of your smoke thing?

00:36:45.297 --> 00:36:46.977
- LUCAS: The Stupefacio.

00:36:47.063 --> 00:36:49.529
- AMICIA: Lucas, use that Stupefacio.

00:36:51.372 --> 00:36:53.839
- LUCAS: Hurry, it'll fade away soon.

00:37:01.762 --> 00:37:04.362
- AMICIA: Hugo is somewhere down there.

00:37:04.273 --> 00:37:05.873
I hope he's alright.

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.306
- LUCAS: The city's days are numbered.

00:37:07.132 --> 00:37:09.999
- AMICIA: Yes...
Let's go back to our house.

00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:22.406
- LUCAS: Do you know where we're going?

00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:24.734
- AMICIA: No... Just... pushing forward.

00:37:26.563 --> 00:37:28.763
- AMICIA: Under the table. Quick!

00:37:28.375 --> 00:37:29.575
- LUCAS: Oh no.

00:37:35.235 --> 00:37:36.915
- AMICIA: Stay still.

00:37:44.672 --> 00:37:45.672
Let's go.

00:38:01.985 --> 00:38:03.985
- LUCAS: Good. We're doing it.

00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:04.985
- AMICIA: We are.

00:38:12.672 --> 00:38:15.616
- LUCAS: Hey, that's the main gate down there.

00:38:14.813 --> 00:38:16.218
- AMICIA: It's so close.

00:38:16.266 --> 00:38:18.066
We need to find a way down.

00:38:17.422 --> 00:38:19.822
- LUCAS: Can't wait to be back home.

00:38:18.969 --> 00:38:22.437
- AMICIA: Mother will be so furious.
I let everyone down.

00:38:22.484 --> 00:38:24.884
- LUCAS: Don't think about that now.

00:38:34.406 --> 00:38:36.206
- AMICIA: Here. A way down.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:37.610
Oh...

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.328
Lucas, I think we've found that depot.

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:41.655
- LUCAS: Really?

00:38:41.531 --> 00:38:43.131
Yes... You're right.

00:38:43.453 --> 00:38:44.733
So that means...

00:38:45.078 --> 00:38:47.172
...the nightshade should be somewhere here.

00:38:46.797 --> 00:38:48.062
- AMICIA: And my sling, too.

00:38:48.094 --> 00:38:51.281
Alright, you look for the nightshade,
I'll look for my sling.

00:38:51.313 --> 00:38:52.513
We may need it.

00:38:52.297 --> 00:38:54.030
- LUCAS: Right.
Nightshade.

00:38:54.563 --> 00:38:56.563
I hope it's still in my pouch.

00:39:03.188 --> 00:39:04.937
- AMICIA: Weapons.

00:39:05.031 --> 00:39:07.421
Swords, knives.

00:39:09.219 --> 00:39:10.219
No sling.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.180
Let's try somewhere else.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.790
Let's pray no one comes in.

00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:15.689
Or we're...

00:39:15.435 --> 00:39:16.555
- LUCAS: No...

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.290
Don't say that word.

00:39:17.928 --> 00:39:19.048
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:39:25.828 --> 00:39:28.628
Looks locked.
Maybe with a knife?

00:39:33.703 --> 00:39:35.063
Oh, here you are.

00:39:35.234 --> 00:39:36.234
I've got it.

00:39:36.016 --> 00:39:38.416
- LUCAS: Careful with that, alright?

00:39:37.703 --> 00:39:39.063
- AMICIA: I know.

00:39:39.516 --> 00:39:41.196
- LUCAS: That smell...

00:39:40.891 --> 00:39:41.891
That's...

00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:43.016
Yes...

00:39:42.938 --> 00:39:45.071
I've got the nightshade, Amicia.

00:39:44.578 --> 00:39:46.018
- AMICIA: Finally.

00:39:45.547 --> 00:39:47.480
This hasn't been for nothing.

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:57.927 line:20%
- SOLDIER 1: So... how long before we go?

00:39:56.016 --> 00:39:57.016
- AMICIA: Guards.

00:39:58.213 --> 00:40:00.276 line:20%
- SOLDIER 2: Don't know. Don't care.

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:02.695 line:20%
You don't wanna go out there, believe me!

00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:05.385
- AMICIA: Damn. The gate is right there.

00:40:04.922 --> 00:40:07.640
- LUCAS: That's too many.
I can't sneak past them.

00:40:07.952 --> 00:40:10.906
- AMICIA: And we can't stay either.
We need a plan.

00:40:10.953 --> 00:40:12.633
- LUCAS: I don't know.

00:40:12.969 --> 00:40:15.102
This place is full of... things.

00:40:15.031 --> 00:40:17.365
- AMICIA: Let's take a look around.

00:40:17.563 --> 00:40:20.229
- LUCAS: Of course...
You see what I see?

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:20.950
- AMICIA: What?

00:40:22.281 --> 00:40:23.721
- LUCAS: Up there.

00:40:23.953 --> 00:40:25.233
- LUCAS: Listen.

00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:29.625
I've gathered enough materials here
to make a large quantity of Stupefacio.

00:40:29.688 --> 00:40:32.078
So we'll stick the paste
to the tip of the bolt.

00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:36.813
Shoot it and hopefully the friction
from the impact will light it up.

00:40:36.594 --> 00:40:38.953
- AMICIA: And we'll get enough smokes
to blind them all.

00:40:38.766 --> 00:40:40.446
- LUCAS: If it works.

00:40:39.781 --> 00:40:43.109
- AMICIA: We don't have any better idea.
Let's get that ballister down.

00:40:43.156 --> 00:40:45.423
- LUCAS: There's a crank up there.

00:40:44.234 --> 00:40:46.796
- AMICIA: How can we climb up?
I don't see anything.

00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:48.401
- LUCAS: There has to be something.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.747
- SOLDIER: Hey, go fetch more men!

00:40:50.957 --> 00:40:53.367
We're doubling the headcount on patrols.

00:40:53.391 --> 00:40:56.463
- AMICIA: We must hurry.
There'll even more soon.

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.719
- LUCAS: Well... I don't know.

00:40:57.641 --> 00:41:00.174
This place is a mess.
There could be...

00:41:02.422 --> 00:41:04.222
There... I've found a cart.

00:41:04.344 --> 00:41:07.608
- AMICIA: Yes... Well done.
Let's get that in place.

00:41:13.766 --> 00:41:15.446
They're far too quiet.

00:41:15.277 --> 00:41:17.507
- LUCAS: The mess in town
must be playing to our advantage.

00:41:17.531 --> 00:41:20.065
- AMICIA: Yes, they're getting scared.

00:41:32.047 --> 00:41:33.047
Good.

00:41:37.766 --> 00:41:39.446
Let's man that crank.

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.151
You handle it.

00:41:42.047 --> 00:41:43.647
- LUCAS: Right away.

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:46.719
Down we go.

00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:49.602
- AMICIA: It's working.

00:41:49.938 --> 00:41:50.978
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.500
- AMICIA: The chain's cut.
You can let go.

00:41:58.031 --> 00:41:59.151
- LUCAS: Good.

00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:00.875
- AMICIA: Let's get it to the door, quick.

00:42:07.672 --> 00:42:09.352
We've only got one shot.

00:42:09.188 --> 00:42:10.468
- LUCAS: I know.

00:42:09.906 --> 00:42:13.109
- AMICIA: If we failed, Hugo will be alone and...

00:42:13.172 --> 00:42:14.852
- LUCAS: And we'll die.

00:42:17.942 --> 00:42:19.039
- AMICIA: Let's stop here.

00:42:19.063 --> 00:42:21.125
- LUCAS: Wait, the Stupefacio.

00:42:21.203 --> 00:42:23.270
- AMICIA: This is crazy, Lucas.

00:42:22.844 --> 00:42:25.244
- LUCAS: I think we past that point.

00:42:25.297 --> 00:42:26.737
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:42:29.016 --> 00:42:30.456
- LUCAS: It's set.

00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:32.643
I think the crank on the side arms it.

00:42:32.172 --> 00:42:33.904
- AMICIA: I'm on it.

00:42:33.714 --> 00:42:35.914
So... when do you open the doors?

00:42:35.591 --> 00:42:39.766
- LUCAS: I won't. Shoot through it.
We need friction to get the reaction.

00:42:39.386 --> 00:42:43.020
- AMICIA: What? But... we don't even know
if it will go through.

00:42:42.802 --> 00:42:44.602
- LUCAS: Too late for that.

00:42:44.659 --> 00:42:45.690
- AMICIA: Get ready.

00:42:45.468 --> 00:42:46.588
- LUCAS: I am.

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:56.192
It worked.

00:42:56.766 --> 00:43:01.000
(COUGHING)

00:43:08.094 --> 00:43:10.894
- BÉATRICE: At last,
what took you so long?

00:43:10.484 --> 00:43:12.164
- AMICIA: Well... I...

00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:14.741
- LUCAS: The herbalist was out
when we arrived. We had to wait.

00:43:14.953 --> 00:43:16.633
But we have everything.

00:43:16.375 --> 00:43:18.975
- BÉATRICE: We should give this to him.

00:43:17.656 --> 00:43:20.600
- VAUDIN: Yes, we've lost enough time already.

00:43:20.734 --> 00:43:22.334
- AMICIA: How is he?

00:43:21.391 --> 00:43:24.296
- BÉATRICE: Exhausted.
He felt asleep when it calmed down.

00:43:24.422 --> 00:43:25.438
- AMICIA: Please, tell him...

00:43:24.703 --> 00:43:28.109
- VAUDIN: He's fine. He's in good hands.
That's the best you can be sure.

00:43:28.313 --> 00:43:30.579
- AMICIA: I hope so.
For your sake.

00:43:30.828 --> 00:43:32.268
- VAUDIN: (SCOFFS)
