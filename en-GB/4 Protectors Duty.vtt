00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:36.992
IV - PROTECTOR'S DUTY

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.521
- LUCAS: Don't.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:47.167
I know it's hard
but it has to be done.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:48.598
- AMICIA: It's been two days.

00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:51.276
How can you stand there
and do nothing?

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:53.486
He doesn't deserve this.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.219
I'm taking him out of there.

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.861
- LUCAS: Amicia, don't.

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:58.008 line:20%
- VAUDIN: The Carrier reaching the last threshold,
there's a rare event.

00:00:58.087 --> 00:00:59.287 line:20%
A critical one.

00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:03.156
Of course, from now on,
we need to isolate him.

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:04.986
The Order has special buildings.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.299
- AMICIA: You want to lock him away?

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:09.899
- VAUDIN: Do you know
what your brother is capable of?

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:11.376
He would do much worse.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.789
- AMICIA: Hey! He's a child!

00:01:13.852 --> 00:01:15.532
This is not his fault!

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.516
And the more you hurt him...

00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:19.696
The more rats are out there
and the more people die!

00:01:19.743 --> 00:01:22.687
- VAUDIN: This is why
we need to take him away.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.680
His power will grow stronger
as his days draw shorter.

00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:28.411
- BÉATRICE: Magister, please.

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.365
- AMICIA: What? What do you mean?

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.970
- BÉATRICE: Amicia...

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.761
Hugo is condemned.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.175
- VAUDIN: The last threshold
means the death of the Carrier.

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:38.761
- AMICIA: No... There must be a way...

00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:40.607
Lucas managed to...

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:43.711
- VAUDIN: Your friend... bought you time
when your brother reached the first threshold.

00:01:43.743 --> 00:01:45.993
But this is something else.

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:47.767
There is no stopping it.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.539
No elixir, no potion.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.849
- AMICIA: Wait.

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:53.243
There's an island,
he keeps talking about an island.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040
Maybe the Macula is behind it.

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.649
- VAUDIN: It is a child's fantasy.

00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:56.671
- AMICIA: We need...

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.367
- AMICIA: So what a child's fantasy doing
on the wall of your laboratory?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.470
Yes... what's out there?

00:02:06.587 --> 00:02:08.267
- VAUDIN: Poor girl...

00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:10.381
You're running away from reality.

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:13.305
You must accept your brother's fate
and your own.

00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:17.852
And the fate of a Protector is to do
what the Order commands.

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.211
- AMICIA: I don't give a damn about your order.

00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:22.843
I don't know you, I don't work for you.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.959
Let me see him!

00:02:24.024 --> 00:02:28.540
- BÉATRICE: Hugo is tired, Amicia.
You can't enter his room in your state.

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.196
- AMICIA: Let... me... past!

00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:33.055
- BÉATRICE: Not until you've calmed down.
You've said it yourself...

00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:35.196
the Macula feeds on his emotion.

00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:38.830
- AMICIA: (FRUSTRATINGLY SHOUTS)

00:02:38.977 --> 00:02:40.642
- VAUDIN: We are going...

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.915
...to the Order's quarter
in Marseille as soon as possible

00:02:44.103 --> 00:02:45.243
I've got a boat...

00:02:45.274 --> 00:02:47.941
And a man, Joseph,
waiting at the habour.

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:49.642
He needs to be warned.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.305
As for me, I'm going to rest.

00:02:52.337 --> 00:02:54.737
Let me know when you're ready to go.

00:02:56.774 --> 00:02:58.214
- BÉATRICE: Lucas.

00:02:58.087 --> 00:03:01.196
Please go to the habour
and find this Joseph.

00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:03.001
- LUCAS: Yes, Magistra.

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:08.384
Amicia...

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:11.242
You should come.

00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:18.767
- BÉATRICE: Be careful...

00:03:18.853 --> 00:03:19.853
Both of you.

00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:30.591
- LUCAS: Are you...

00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:31.681
...alright?

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:32.518
- AMICIA: No!

00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:34.408
Did you know about Hugo?

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.299
- LUCAS: I...

00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:37.311
I wanted to tell you, but...

00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.531
- AMICIA: You should've.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.103
We're talking about my brother, Lucas.

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:44.216
- LUCAS: I didn't know Magister Vaudin
would tell you like this.

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.235
- AMICIA: Lord... I can't...

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:48.045
(FRUSTRATION) Let's just keep going.

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:48.328
- LUCAS: Fine.

00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:34.228
- SOLDIER: Here ye... A curfew
has been ordered by the Count of Arles.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.899
All townsfolks stay in your homes.

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:38.607
- AMICIA: A patrol.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:39.674
- MAN: What's going on?

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:43.056
- SOLDIER: The city is under lockdown.
Anyone caught on the street will be arrested.

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:45.962
- AMICIA: There we are.
They're locking down the whole city.

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:51.924
- LUCAS: I don't know.

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:53.706
- AMICIA: We need that boat quickly.

00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:08.460
- SOLDIER: There is no need to panic.

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:11.431
The Army of Provence said
the situation is under control.

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:14.889
- AMICIA: Yes... Now tell them
what your <i>"control"</i> means.

00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:18.415
- LUCAS: Look, that watch tower at the back.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.830
It leads to the harbour.

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:22.665
- SOLDIER: Get ready, men.
We'll move our lodge to the docks soon.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.967
- AMICIA: The docks?
That's where we're going, isn't it?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.867
- LUCAS: Those cages
in their cart, I think...

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.509
...dead bodies from the arena.

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:33.387
- AMICIA: So this is where they take them.

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:49.853
- LUCAS: Amicia, when we're there.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.087
You hold your sling, alright?

00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:53.908
We don't need another...

00:05:53.806 --> 00:05:55.478
... ... situation.

00:05:55.853 --> 00:05:58.493
So... no more killing soldiers.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.399
- AMICIA: Don't worry.
I heard you the first time.

00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:03.931
I'll find other ways.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.000
- LUCAS: We're here.

00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:27.352
- AMICIA: Right.

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:52.459
- LUCAS: You...

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:55.883
...asked me to ask Magister Vaudin
about the island.

00:06:55.947 --> 00:06:57.627
The fresco in his lodge.

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:59.243
- AMICIA: What did he say?

00:06:58.822 --> 00:07:01.222
- LUCAS: He said it's just a symbol.

00:07:04.978 --> 00:07:07.111
- LUCAS: I know... The island...

00:07:07.353 --> 00:07:09.486
The Macula waking up the Order.

00:07:09.744 --> 00:07:10.864
It's too much.

00:07:10.884 --> 00:07:12.524
- AMICIA: Glad to hear you say it.

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:14.712
It helps me not to feel alone in this.

00:07:14.337 --> 00:07:15.937
- LUCAS: You're not.

00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:16.697
I'm here.

00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:02.922
I'm sorry, Amicia...

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:04.712
For Hugo.

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:07.798
- AMICIA: He's not dead yet.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.151
- LUCAS: Alright.

00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:16.757
Remember... No more killing soldiers.

00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:18.467
No more killing us.

00:08:18.744 --> 00:08:20.264
- AMICIA: I got it.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.290
No kills... No being spotted.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.500
Let's get this boat.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400
We're here.

00:08:36.712 --> 00:08:38.165
So where's our boat?

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:40.484
- LUCAS: Red and wide sail.
Right there.

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.319
- AMICIA: It's still there. Good.

00:08:42.072 --> 00:08:44.272
- LUCAS: I hope our pilot is too.

00:08:43.744 --> 00:08:45.424
- AMICIA: Good point.

00:09:14.837 --> 00:09:18.165
- SOLDIER: Come on.
We should be at the gate already.

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:20.269
- AMICIA: There they are.
Keep moving. Quiet.

00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:23.446
- SOLDIER 1: Get off my back.
We can't afford to break these jars.

00:09:23.087 --> 00:09:25.149
- SOLDIER 2: The city is running out of time.

00:09:24.744 --> 00:09:27.978
- SOLDIER 1: The city needs
these jars intact. So settle down.

00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:30.884
- SOLDIER 2: You're not arguing, soldier!
Move, move!

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:32.849
- LUCAS: What are they doing?

00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:35.860
This lockdown is gonna get them all killed.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.017
- AMICIA: Yes... It's going to be terrible.

00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:46.493
- SOLDIER: Alright, open the gate.
Get in position.

00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:58.193
- LUCAS: Look at that wall...

00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:58.536
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:00.064
They built it in a hurry.

00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:02.547
And it's blocking our path to the boat.

00:10:01.744 --> 00:10:03.477
- LUCAS: Let's get closer.

00:10:39.994 --> 00:10:41.994
- AMICIA: Let's see that gate.

00:10:46.322 --> 00:10:48.290
Soldiers. Helmeted.

00:10:48.619 --> 00:10:50.419
We'll have to sneak around.

00:10:49.962 --> 00:10:52.571
- LUCAS: Hopefully there's a sideway
to pass that gate.

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:54.337
- AMICIA: What do you think is behind it?

00:10:57.416 --> 00:10:59.978
- SOLDIER 1: You believe
they'll make it this time?

00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:01.451
- SOLDIER 2: I believe nothing.

00:11:01.478 --> 00:11:04.378
I just know bodies
keep coming from the city.

00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:06.479
And we aren't too many of our own.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.118
- SOLDIER 1: I should've gone
to see my mother when I could.

00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:10.121
- SOLDIER 2: Pray.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.580
It's all we have left.

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.302
- SOLDIER 1: That's not much.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.080
- AMICIA: Through here.

00:11:57.197 --> 00:11:58.237
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:12:10.712 --> 00:12:12.392
- AMICIA: Oh... No...

00:12:12.853 --> 00:12:13.853
Lord...

00:12:14.087 --> 00:12:16.915
It looks... like a battlefield.

00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:17.946
- LUCAS: What...

00:12:17.962 --> 00:12:19.322
...happened here?

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.540
- AMICIA: I don't know.
Let's follow that cart.

00:12:22.603 --> 00:12:24.283
And keep our eyes opened.

00:12:31.837 --> 00:12:33.357
- LUCAS: I think...

00:12:33.744 --> 00:12:36.077
I know what happened to this place.

00:12:35.462 --> 00:12:38.662
- AMICIA: And they're repeating
the same mistake.

00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:46.151
(GROUND RUMBLING)

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:50.696
(GROUND RUMBLING)

00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:55.871
- LUCAS: Don't go any further, Amicia.

00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:56.371
- AMICIA: Oh Lord!

00:13:01.103 --> 00:13:02.103
Stay back!

00:13:10.416 --> 00:13:12.016
- LUCAS: Impossible.

00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:14.173
- AMICIA: There are so many.

00:13:14.025 --> 00:13:16.092
How are we going to cross <i>that</i>?

00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:22.049
That liquid on the ground,
it's from their jars.

00:13:21.228 --> 00:13:23.095
- LUCAS: It smells like tar.

00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:25.520
If it is, it's... it's highly flammable.

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:26.986
Try setting it on fire.

00:13:26.837 --> 00:13:29.306
- AMICIA: Yes... yes. Let's try.

00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:53.581
- AMICIA: Careful with those flames.

00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:05.231
- LUCAS: That brazier... It can be pushed.

00:14:04.728 --> 00:14:05.848
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.418
This is all wrong.

00:14:15.462 --> 00:14:18.329
- LUCAS: Let's hope Marseille is different.

00:14:17.025 --> 00:14:19.166
- AMICIA: Wait until the rats invade it.

00:14:18.962 --> 00:14:23.186
- LUCAS: Amicia, the Order
will have special buildings in Marseille

00:14:23.212 --> 00:14:25.259
Equipment. And people.

00:14:25.306 --> 00:14:27.239
- AMICIA: People like Vaudin?

00:14:26.712 --> 00:14:28.779
How do you think this will end?

00:14:30.806 --> 00:14:33.073
It's staying here is dying anyway.

00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:38.096
- LUCAS: Joseph's boat.

00:14:37.447 --> 00:14:39.513
- AMICIA: We're getting closer.

00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.701
Ah... More of them.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.533
- LUCAS: That building on the left looks safer.

00:15:19.181 --> 00:15:22.048
The rats destroyed the rest of the pontoon.

00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:24.298
- AMICIA: Let's hope we'll be able to pass.

00:15:39.009 --> 00:15:40.689
Let's try through here.

00:15:47.884 --> 00:15:49.244
- LUCAS: Urghh...

00:15:49.587 --> 00:15:50.587
What a mess.

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.932
- AMICIA: Wowurgh... That smell...

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.440
- LUCAS: Tar...

00:15:53.572 --> 00:15:55.252
...makes your head spinned.

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:57.049
- AMICIA: I don't hear any rats.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:57.770
- LUCAS: No...

00:15:58.369 --> 00:16:00.759
But they were here.
Look at this.

00:16:00.603 --> 00:16:01.963
- AMICIA: Lord...

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:03.354
What is all this?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.080
- LUCAS: A tar workshop.

00:16:05.525 --> 00:16:07.696
They must've used it to seal boat holes.

00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:09.689
These mechanisms are still intact.

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:11.843
- AMICIA: It smells different here.

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:12.459
- LUCAS: Resin.

00:16:12.603 --> 00:16:14.283
This is a mixing pool.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.539
That barrel up there must be the ....

00:16:15.822 --> 00:16:17.688
- AMICIA: We should move on.

00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:19.369
Oh no!

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.373
- LUCAS: Stay back!

00:16:24.369 --> 00:16:26.769
- LUCAS: Don't panic! We have resin.

00:16:26.807 --> 00:16:29.736
It just need that ... up there
and we'll get tar.

00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:31.494
- AMICIA: A pool of tar.

00:16:31.168 --> 00:16:33.316
That could be our way
to that door in the back.

00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:35.126
- LUCAS: That barrel is pretty high though.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.962
- AMICIA: We could find a way to reach it.

00:16:36.338 --> 00:16:37.858
- LUCAS: Let's see.

00:16:37.978 --> 00:16:40.312
These ropes make the platform move.

00:16:43.213 --> 00:16:45.413
- AMICIA: We must get over there.

00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:50.726
So we're making tar now.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.251
- LUCAS: I know.
But it shouldn't take us long.

00:16:53.017 --> 00:16:55.151
- AMICIA: Well, let's get to it.

00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:30.870
- AMICIA: I'm letting go. Hang on.

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.617
- LUCAS: Come back to the basin.

00:17:33.955 --> 00:17:35.315
- AMICIA: Coming.

00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:43.955
- AMICIA: Are we ready?

00:17:46.715 --> 00:17:49.115
- LUCAS: Yes... Let's make that tar.

00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:51.350
- AMICIA: Do you know the quantities?

00:17:51.051 --> 00:17:53.134
- LUCAS: No, I'm improvising.

00:17:53.187 --> 00:17:55.320
- AMICIA: Please, don't kill us.

00:17:56.754 --> 00:17:57.874
- LUCAS: Good.

00:17:58.057 --> 00:18:00.057
I think you could light it up.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.020
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:18:00.348 --> 00:18:02.882
- LUCAS: Let's see would our tar work.

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:06.989
- AMICIA: Here we go.

00:18:07.926 --> 00:18:09.526
Hah... It's working!

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:10.503
- LUCAS: Yes!

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:16.742
Well... that's one step.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.637
- AMICIA: What now? I'm stuck.

00:18:18.187 --> 00:18:19.467
- LUCAS: Wait...

00:18:19.267 --> 00:18:20.467
I think they...

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.433
...experiment with some ingredients here.

00:18:24.007 --> 00:18:25.687
Yes, that could work.

00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:27.393
I'll throw it to you.

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.564
- AMICIA: Those beasts are really close!

00:18:31.312 --> 00:18:34.320
- LUCAS: Here...
Say when you're ready to catch.

00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:35.802
- AMICIA: Go.

00:18:37.978 --> 00:18:40.578
- LUCAS: You got resin and alcohol now.

00:18:40.218 --> 00:18:41.218
Mix them.

00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:43.879
- AMICIA: Done.

00:18:52.288 --> 00:18:53.968
- AMICIA: Please work.

00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:56.540
- LUCAS: Let's see would our tar work.

00:19:00.062 --> 00:19:01.502
- AMICIA: Perfect!

00:19:00.986 --> 00:19:02.026
- LUCAS: Yes!

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.673
That last pool there
is already full of tar.

00:19:04.163 --> 00:19:05.523
- AMICIA: Coming.

00:19:20.765 --> 00:19:22.632
- AMICIA: Anyway, thank you.

00:19:22.484 --> 00:19:24.217
- LUCAS: No need for that.

00:19:50.114 --> 00:19:51.923
Our boat should be straight ahead, right?

00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:53.238
- AMICIA: Don't be too sure about that.

00:19:53.004 --> 00:19:54.738
- LUCAS: Listen, Amicia...

00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:56.689
About Hugo...

00:19:57.106 --> 00:20:00.818
I was stuck between Magister Vaudin
and your mother and...

00:20:01.077 --> 00:20:02.597
I have no excuse...

00:20:03.343 --> 00:20:04.463
I was wrong...

00:20:04.254 --> 00:20:05.934
- AMICIA: It's just...

00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:07.661
I wasn't prepared.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.690
I can't lose him.

00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:11.153
I can't.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.027
- LUCAS: We'll do what's right.

00:20:12.327 --> 00:20:13.767
- AMICIA: We will.

00:20:37.145 --> 00:20:38.185
Through here.

00:21:08.161 --> 00:21:09.749
- LUCAS: Look! Over there!

00:21:09.788 --> 00:21:10.908
Joseph's ship.

00:21:11.885 --> 00:21:13.565
- AMICIA: Yes, let's go.

00:21:13.968 --> 00:21:17.040
Hurghh... They're here.
It's infested down there.

00:21:16.911 --> 00:21:18.511
- LUCAS: Wait, look.

00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:40.211
- AMICIA: Lord...

00:27:42.862 --> 00:27:44.862
I'm done trusting any of them.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.920
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:27:50.596 --> 00:27:52.596
- AMICIA: Let's see that boat.

00:27:53.747 --> 00:27:55.908
- SOLDIER: It's a public health matter.

00:27:55.961 --> 00:27:59.161
You should've left
when you're still could, Joseph.

00:27:59.555 --> 00:28:03.760
- JOSEPH: I'm waiting for a client
and I'm always on my contract, my friend.

00:28:03.578 --> 00:28:06.012
- SOLDIER: Consider your contract cancel then.

00:28:05.857 --> 00:28:09.057
The harbour is locked down and you're trespassing.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.360
- LUCAS: He's our man.

00:28:08.617 --> 00:28:09.737
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:28:09.424 --> 00:28:11.156
And trouble's coming.
We need to move.

00:28:10.948 --> 00:28:13.682
- JOSEPH: Alright, you know what...
I've got better place to be.

00:28:13.734 --> 00:28:16.134
- SOLDIER: No! You've seen too much.

00:28:15.922 --> 00:28:17.362
I'm arresting you!

00:28:16.716 --> 00:28:18.449
- JOSEPH: Oh... come on...

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.490
You know what?

00:28:19.893 --> 00:28:20.893
Piss off!

- JOSEPH: Stay where you are!

00:28:29.997 --> 00:28:32.380
- AMICIA: We're here
on behalf of Magister Vaudin.

00:28:32.185 --> 00:28:33.865
We need to leave town.

00:28:33.982 --> 00:28:37.393
- JOSEPH: What'd you think I'm doing?
This place is a mess.

00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:39.712
- LUCAS: Please! We're stuck here!

00:28:39.971 --> 00:28:41.651
There's a child with us.

00:28:43.708 --> 00:28:45.508
- JOSEPH: Alright, alright.

00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:47.072
Meet me at the next pontoon.

00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:51.429
- SOLDIER: Who are you?
Where are the captain?

00:28:51.482 --> 00:28:52.482
Shit...

00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:54.237
Intruders!! Oof...

00:28:55.805 --> 00:28:57.405
- JOSEPH: Move! Now!

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.630
- AMICIA: Yes... Come on!

00:33:12.986 --> 00:33:14.186
- JOSEPH: Damn!

00:33:13.949 --> 00:33:15.238
I thought you'd never make it.

00:33:15.251 --> 00:33:16.251
Come.

00:33:17.113 --> 00:33:18.844
- AMICIA: Thanks for not letting us down.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.068

00:33:22.321 --> 00:33:24.721
Now, where is the rest of the group?

00:33:24.847 --> 00:33:26.813
- AMICIA: In town,
getting ready to leave.

00:33:34.939 --> 00:33:36.219
I'll go get them

00:33:36.137 --> 00:33:39.081
