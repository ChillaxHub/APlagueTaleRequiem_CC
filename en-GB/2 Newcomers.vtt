Why is the wall red?

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:38.306
- AMICIA: I've heard the earth
in this region is red in some places.

00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:40.053
They call it <i>The Oches</i>.

00:14:10.127 --> 00:14:11.407
- HUGO: Wowww...

00:14:11.254 --> 00:14:12.934
- AMICIA: It looks quiet.

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:14.409
- HUGO: And it's less hotter.

00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:15.441
- AMICIA: It's nice!

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:21.953
- LUCAS: Ready to come inside?

00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:23.597
- AMICIA: Yes, lead the way.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.016
We're home, Hugo.

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:28.563
Our new home!

00:14:29.707 --> 00:14:31.387
Let's take a look around.

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:33.075
- HUGO: Hm...

00:14:33.558 --> 00:14:34.558
Yes...

00:14:34.752 --> 00:14:37.174
- AMICIA: Alright, we'll do that later.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.057
Mother, where's Hugo's room?
He's exhausted.

00:14:40.105 --> 00:14:42.067
- BÉATRICE: Upstairs.
The bed is ready.

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.507
- AMICIA: Thanks.

00:14:44.214 --> 00:14:45.947
Come on, you sleepy beast.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.340
- HUGO: You must come, Amicia.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.750
- AMICIA: Come where?

00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:03.189
- HUGO: The island.

00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:05.414
You'll be healed there too.

00:15:06.195 --> 00:15:07.555
- AMICIA: Healed?

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:10.608
Well, that would be nice, I'm sure.

00:15:11.802 --> 00:15:13.322
- HUGO: It will be.

00:15:25.099 --> 00:15:29.829
- BÉATRICE: You're thinking too much.
Sometimes it's better just to trust your feelings.

00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.912
- LUCAS: I'm trying... But I...

00:15:33.286 --> 00:15:35.286
I just stuck in the logic of it.

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:39.095
- BÉATRICE: Substances obey natural law.
The Macula does too.

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:42.615
You don't need logic, Lucas.
You just need to be human.

00:15:43.295 --> 00:15:45.095
- LUCAS: Maybe... (SIGHS)

00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:47.123
I'm just not very good at being human.

00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:50.275
- BÉATRICE: You are.
This is why you have doubts.

00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:54.010
- AMICIA: No, NO!

00:15:54.062 --> 00:15:56.157
Hugo, Hugo NO!

00:15:57.617 --> 00:15:59.982
And I'll kill you again if I had to!

00:15:58.856 --> 00:16:00.056 line:20%
- HUGO: Amicia!

00:15:59.903 --> 00:16:02.109
I'LL KILL ALL OF YOU!

00:16:00.348 --> 00:16:01.708 line:20%
- BÉATRICE: Hugo?

00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:05.045 line:20%
- LUCAS: Amicia, Amicia!

00:16:03.632 --> 00:16:05.072
(SCREECHING SOUND)

00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:10.756
- BÉATRICE: He had a nightmare.

00:16:11.963 --> 00:16:13.643
- AMICIA: The Macula...

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.953
- LUCAS: It's the shock.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.336
What happened today must have woken it.

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:23.463
- BÉATRICE: We had six months of respite
after he passed the second threshold.

00:16:23.527 --> 00:16:26.313
But the balance
of his blood is very delicate.

00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:28.864
Amicia, go with Lucas.

00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:32.316
Magister Vaudin is somewhere in this town.

00:16:32.364 --> 00:16:34.475
Find him and tell him to come quickly.

00:16:34.507 --> 00:16:36.187
- AMICIA: Right away.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.160
- BÉATRICE: Amicia...

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.813
- AMICIA: I know. We'll be careful.

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:45.919
(DOOR SHUTS)

00:16:50.169 --> 00:16:53.177
It's because of those farmers.
I should never...

00:16:53.201 --> 00:16:54.852
(FRUSTRATINGLY EXHALES)

00:16:54.884 --> 00:16:56.817
- LUCAS: It's not your fault.

00:16:56.342 --> 00:16:58.542
- AMICIA: How can you be so sure?

00:16:57.738 --> 00:17:00.144
- LUCAS: You can't control
what happens in his blood.

00:17:00.192 --> 00:17:01.925
The Macula keeps evolving.

00:17:01.963 --> 00:17:04.116
Pushing the Carrier
through different thresholds.

00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:06.950
- AMICIA: Will this...
Magister Vaudin really help?

00:17:06.998 --> 00:17:09.895
- LUCAS: The Order has been studying
the Macula for centuries.

00:17:09.943 --> 00:17:11.223
If they can't...

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.841
...I don't know who can.

00:17:12.904 --> 00:17:15.316
- AMICIA: Lord... Protect him.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.023
Why hasn't Vaudin showed up already?

00:17:21.055 --> 00:17:22.842
- LUCAS: I think he's just been discreet.

00:17:22.906 --> 00:17:24.639
The Order works like this.

00:17:24.385 --> 00:17:27.905
- AMICIA: Someone must know about him.
Let's ask around.

00:17:32.826 --> 00:17:35.559
- LUCAS: Here, a town guard.
I'll ask him.

00:17:37.997 --> 00:17:41.250
Er... Hello... Excuse me...

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.725
Would you know the whereabouts
of Magister Vaudin?

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:47.360
- GUARD: Er... I've heard of a Sir Vaudin,
not a Magister.

00:17:47.392 --> 00:17:50.269
Try the marketplace.
There're a couple of florists there.

00:17:50.349 --> 00:17:52.777
I think they deal with him
from time to time.

00:17:52.523 --> 00:17:54.043
- LUCAS: Thank you!

00:17:57.456 --> 00:17:59.522
- AMICIA: Good. That's a start.

00:17:59.354 --> 00:18:00.830
- LUCAS: I should've known.

00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:03.308
Of course he doesn't go by
his Order's title publicly.

00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:08.380
- AMICIA: We came by a florist earlier.
It's somewhere around this marketplace.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.180
Hello again.

00:18:16.212 --> 00:18:17.945
- FLORIST: Oh... it's you!

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.768
Looking flowers for the little one?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.150
- AMICIA: Actually,
I'm looking for Sir Vaudin.

00:18:22.182 --> 00:18:23.756
I believe he's one of your clients.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.900
- FLORIST: He's my husband's client.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.225
He's the one who deals in medicinal herbs.

00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:29.034
- AMICIA: Ah...

00:18:29.082 --> 00:18:31.392
- FLORIST: But Martin should be
right by the fountain.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.884
Just tell him I sent you.

00:18:32.964 --> 00:18:34.426
He's wearing a brown tunic.

00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:37.547
- AMICIA: Brown tunic...
Thank you for your help!

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.840
- LUCAS: Let's hope he tells us.
- AMICIA: He will.

00:18:51.449 --> 00:18:54.349
- AMICIA: Excuse me, sir. Your wife sent us.

00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:55.017
- LUCAS: Hello sir. Your wife sent us.

00:18:54.131 --> 00:18:55.648
- MARTIN: Now what does she want now?

00:18:55.728 --> 00:18:57.277
I'm busy cleaning this mess.

00:18:57.309 --> 00:19:00.016
- AMICIA: It's not for her.
We must find Sir Vaudin.

00:19:00.048 --> 00:19:02.948
- MARTIN: Him?
He doesn't like to be bothered.

00:19:03.249 --> 00:19:04.204
Just like me.

00:19:04.284 --> 00:19:07.096
- AMICIA: Listen, my brother is very sick
and we need him immediately.

00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:09.509
- MARTIN: (SIGHS) Alright, alright.

00:19:09.956 --> 00:19:12.022
I don't know precisely where...

00:19:12.246 --> 00:19:15.849
But I think he lives close
to the arena down there.

00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:18.766
But <i>don't</i> tell him I sent you.
- LUCAS: Don't worry.

00:19:18.862 --> 00:19:21.934
Thank you.
- AMICIA: Right, let's not waste time.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.686
The arena district.

00:19:27.452 --> 00:19:28.882
- LUCAS: That's a lot of houses.

00:19:28.739 --> 00:19:31.339
- AMICIA: How are we going to find him?

00:19:36.056 --> 00:19:37.056
It's a slum.

00:19:37.724 --> 00:19:40.561
The Order is not poor
so what would a Magister be doing here?

00:19:40.641 --> 00:19:42.063
- LUCAS: Probably hiding.

00:19:41.873 --> 00:19:43.393
- AMICIA: Probably.

00:19:44.844 --> 00:19:46.124
- LUCAS: Amicia.

00:19:46.177 --> 00:19:47.415
That symbol on the wall.

00:19:47.463 --> 00:19:48.743
- AMICIA: The Order.

00:19:48.315 --> 00:19:50.115
- LUCAS: Yes. He's in here.

00:19:50.182 --> 00:19:53.190
- GUARD: No one gets in.
The arena is off-limits.

00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:54.612
- AMICIA: Why is that?

00:19:54.407 --> 00:19:57.938
- GUARD: Because the Count of Provence said so.
Get going please.

00:19:57.732 --> 00:19:59.446
- AMICIA: Listen. I really need to pass.

00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:02.636
- LUCAS: It's alright. Come.
We'll go around the arena.

00:20:02.716 --> 00:20:04.783
- AMICIA: (FRUSTRATINGLY EXHALES)

00:20:09.155 --> 00:20:11.484
- LUCAS: Now it's not the time
to argue with soldiers.

00:20:11.563 --> 00:20:12.579
Let's look around.

00:20:12.643 --> 00:20:14.135
- AMICIA: You're right. Sorry.

00:20:14.183 --> 00:20:15.944
- LUCAS: There's a door up there.
- AMICIA: Yes!

00:20:25.275 --> 00:20:26.395
- LUCAS: So...

00:20:26.545 --> 00:20:28.225
Ready to break the law?

00:20:29.192 --> 00:20:30.632
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:27.833
Is it...?

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:30.434
- LUCAS: <i>The Bite</i>, yes.

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:33.696
They've locked the arena down.
They let them die here.

00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:36.572
- AMICIA: It's starting all over again.

00:21:36.684 --> 00:21:37.874
- LUCAS: Not starting.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:38.922
Spreading.

00:21:39.414 --> 00:21:40.414
Hugo...

00:21:40.891 --> 00:21:42.411
We brought it here.

00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:45.906
- AMICIA: Let's find Magister Vaudin.

00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:47.787
If he's not dead already.

00:21:51.403 --> 00:21:53.339
- LUCAS: I can't believe
they let them to rot here.

00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:54.950
- AMICIA: These people were poor.

00:21:54.966 --> 00:21:57.866
- LUCAS: They must be from the slum outside.

00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:03.666
- AMICIA: How can nobody
notice their disappearance?

00:22:03.159 --> 00:22:05.025
- LUCAS: Maybe nobody cares.

00:22:04.762 --> 00:22:06.042
- AMICIA: Maybe.

00:22:08.631 --> 00:22:10.631
- LUCAS: Here. Another symbol.

00:22:10.409 --> 00:22:12.676
- AMICIA: Well, let's get in then.

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:15.037
You think these symbols will lead to him?

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.220
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.669
Look. An opening up there.

00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:21.233
- AMICIA: There must be a way to climb up.

00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:24.235
This could help.
- LUCAS: I'll give you a hand.

00:22:24.307 --> 00:22:27.482
- AMICIA: If Vaudin's here, he's in trouble.
- LUCAS: He knows <i>The Bite</i>.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.243
He must be avoiding the sick.
- AMICIA: Lucas...

00:22:30.275 --> 00:22:32.418
If all these people here were bitten...

00:22:32.466 --> 00:22:33.586
...it means...

00:22:35.116 --> 00:22:36.608
- LUCAS: Maybe not...

00:22:36.656 --> 00:22:39.664
A sick person could've
brought it inside the city.

- LUCAS: (WHISPERS) Not good.

00:23:01.898 --> 00:23:04.438
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) He has a helmet.
I can't do anything.

00:23:04.486 --> 00:23:06.166
- LUCAS: (WHISPERS) What do we do?

00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:09.412
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Let's just pass.
Not a sound.

00:23:11.315 --> 00:23:15.871
- SOLDIER: You're alone. And I've all the time
in the world. Just talk to me.

00:23:15.208 --> 00:23:16.985
- AMICIA: That brute is not a soldier.

00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:19.281
- LUCAS: But he's dressed as one.

00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:21.739 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Not a single coin.

00:23:21.102 --> 00:23:23.302
- AMICIA: No! How many are there?

00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:24.223 line:20%
- SOLDIER: I'd better focus on our man.

00:23:24.318 --> 00:23:26.985 line:20%
If I find him, I could ask for a reward.

00:23:28.207 --> 00:23:30.207
- LUCAS: Amicia, he'll see us.

00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:31.600
- AMICIA: I'll make him move.

for letting you die here like a dog.

Damn... That's an ugly ...

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:46.373

00:24:01.824 --> 00:24:04.777 line:20%
- SOLDIER 1: So, any sign of the doctor?
I've heard nothing yet.

00:24:04.999 --> 00:24:06.519
- AMICIA: A doctor?

00:24:05.968 --> 00:24:09.427 line:20%

pretty good at hiding I tell you.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.189 line:20%

00:24:11.237 --> 00:24:12.853 line:20%
- SOLDIER 2: Shit...

00:24:12.444 --> 00:24:13.967
- AMICIA: So they're after Vaudin too.

00:24:14.015 --> 00:24:15.269
- LUCAS: They think he's a doctor.

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:17.267

00:24:40.977 --> 00:24:42.177 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Huh?

00:24:43.342 --> 00:24:44.622 line:20%
What did I hear?

00:24:52.456 --> 00:24:53.456 line:20%
All clear.

00:25:47.209 --> 00:25:48.569 line:20%
What is it again?

00:26:12.191 --> 00:26:14.778
- AMICIA: Urgh... It stinks.

00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:16.889
- LUCAS: Urgh... What the hell?

00:26:21.714 --> 00:26:23.394
I'm going to be sick!

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.839
- AMICIA: (GASPS) No!

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:26.761
Oof... (COUGHS)

00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:28.497
Please no...

00:26:29.168 --> 00:26:30.500
- LUCAS: Up there.

00:26:30.548 --> 00:26:32.294
Looks like it leads back inside.

00:26:32.707 --> 00:26:36.909
- AMICIA: Let's find something to get up there... Quick!

00:26:48.938 --> 00:26:52.446
- LUCAS: There's some sort of half-cart here.

00:26:52.589 --> 00:26:54.269
But it's not high enough.

00:26:54.567 --> 00:26:56.662
I think they were
moving the bodies with it.

00:26:56.694 --> 00:26:59.727
- AMICIA: That cage up there
looks like the right size.

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:01.693
- LUCAS: It's full of bodies!

00:27:02.494 --> 00:27:05.747
- AMICIA: Don't look at them.
Let's... push it.

00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:10.001
- LUCAS: It's a massacre.
- AMICIA: We brought it here.

00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:11.461
We condemned them.

00:27:11.494 --> 00:27:13.589
- LUCAS: It's still going on in Guyenne.

00:27:13.637 --> 00:27:15.317
It's already spreading.

00:27:15.376 --> 00:27:18.281
- AMICIA: Yes, but...
they would've seen it coming.

00:27:18.329 --> 00:27:21.129
- LUCAS: It wouldn't have changed a thing.

00:27:31.498 --> 00:27:33.231
- AMICIA: Let's go. Quick.

00:27:33.682 --> 00:27:35.999
- LUCAS: There's so many dead already.

00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:37.031
Like it's...

00:27:37.301 --> 00:27:38.981
...one step ahead of us.

00:27:39.322 --> 00:27:42.394
- AMICIA: Yes. But none of them
looked devoured.

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:44.548
- LUCAS: Look.

00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:47.519
I think they were keeping count of the dead.

00:27:48.161 --> 00:27:50.028
- AMICIA: They left a knife.

00:27:50.737 --> 00:27:51.737
It's stuck.

00:27:52.818 --> 00:27:53.818
Come on.

00:27:58.634 --> 00:28:00.683
Let's keep going. Through there.

00:28:00.715 --> 00:28:04.111
- LUCAS: You don't use...
blade against... people.

00:28:04.225 --> 00:28:05.505
- AMICIA: I did.

00:28:06.303 --> 00:28:07.583
I had no choice.

00:28:08.107 --> 00:28:11.084
A blade is silent and quick.
It's what we need now.

00:28:10.815 --> 00:28:12.175
- LUCAS: Alright.

00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:13.745
It's up to you.

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:25.045
Look over there.

00:28:25.194 --> 00:28:26.394
Another symbol.

00:28:26.235 --> 00:28:28.155
- AMICIA: Good. But... Lucas...

00:28:28.203 --> 00:28:30.412
If these people fell ill, it means...

00:28:30.495 --> 00:28:32.362
...some must've been bitten.

00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:33.780
- LUCAS: I've seen no sign of attack.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.349
- AMICIA: Not yet.
Anyway, let's go.

00:28:41.182 --> 00:28:44.647
(DISTANT CHATTER)

00:28:44.714 --> 00:28:48.106
- LUCAS: Soldiers turned bad.
That doesn't sound good.

00:28:51.748 --> 00:28:53.548
- AMICIA: Archer! Up there!

00:29:51.062 --> 00:29:52.862
- LUCAS: Stay out of sight.

00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:00.833
- AMICIA: Stay away.

00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:23.172
They haven't found Vaudin yet.

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:24.409
- LUCAS: He's smarter than them.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.909
- AMICIA: He's alone...

00:30:26.976 --> 00:30:28.774
And if they do, Hugo's lost.

00:30:28.814 --> 00:30:30.494
- LUCAS: You're right.

00:31:48.365 --> 00:31:50.565
- SOLDIER: Huh?
I heard something.

00:32:00.534 --> 00:32:01.574
Nothing here.

00:32:51.609 --> 00:32:53.167
- LUCAS: Yes, we made it.

00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:54.292
- AMICIA: We did.

00:32:54.317 --> 00:32:57.756
But I'm weary of the thieves,
murderers, mercenaries...

00:32:57.796 --> 00:33:00.022
All the bloody scum
that keeps getting in our way.

00:33:00.102 --> 00:33:01.807
- LUCAS: Chaos rules our lives.

00:33:01.888 --> 00:33:03.277
They're part of it.

00:33:03.302 --> 00:33:05.529
And you're getting better
at handling them.

00:33:05.574 --> 00:33:07.852
I see it.
You were pretty discreet back there.

00:33:07.874 --> 00:33:11.714
- AMICIA: Well, better to let live
and not risk dying myself.

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.719
- LUCAS: Argh... Do you smell that?

00:33:24.772 --> 00:33:25.671
- AMICIA: Dead bodies.

00:33:25.751 --> 00:33:27.153
- LUCAS: What is this place?

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.220
A hospital.

00:33:29.947 --> 00:33:31.506
- AMICIA: I think they used to live here.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.252
- LUCAS: No wonder they all fell ill.

00:33:34.827 --> 00:33:35.827
I...

00:33:36.446 --> 00:33:38.126
...can't get used to it.

00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:40.202
- AMICIA: You don't have to.

00:33:41.205 --> 00:34:09.814
(FLIES BUZZING)

00:34:16.848 --> 00:34:18.581
Please tell me this is it.

00:34:28.914 --> 00:34:29.914
Oh, Lord.

00:34:30.422 --> 00:34:31.862
It's a whole city.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:32.856
- LUCAS: The symbol.

00:34:32.922 --> 00:34:34.707
He's in that tower, he has to be.

00:34:34.734 --> 00:34:35.681
- AMICIA: Has to?

00:34:35.748 --> 00:34:38.259
Lucas, crossing this mess
won't be easy or quick.

00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:39.584
- LUCAS: It's the Order.

00:34:39.638 --> 00:34:41.176
A high Magister would just...

00:34:41.203 --> 00:34:42.591
...live in a high tower, no?

00:34:42.631 --> 00:34:45.231
- AMICIA: (SIGHS) Let's just get there.

00:34:51.412 --> 00:34:53.144
(WOOD CREAKING)

00:34:53.184 --> 00:34:55.118
- LUCAS: You sure about this?

00:34:55.947 --> 00:34:57.814
- AMICIA: Well, it's the only way.

00:34:57.872 --> 00:34:59.552
We'll just be careful.

00:35:01.736 --> 00:35:04.341

Ahh...

00:35:20.331 --> 00:35:21.691

(EFFORT GRUNTS)

00:35:37.777 --> 00:35:39.430
- LUCAS: Can you stand up?

00:35:39.549 --> 00:35:41.229
- AMICIA: I'm tryin' to.

00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:49.275
- MAN: Please don't hurt me!

00:35:49.695 --> 00:35:52.595
- AMICIA: Calm down!
We're not with those men.

00:35:52.941 --> 00:35:54.061
You live here?

00:35:55.701 --> 00:35:56.701
- MAN: Yes.

- MAN: What? What is that??

00:36:13.747 --> 00:36:15.427
- LUCAS: They're here!

00:36:15.484 --> 00:36:17.093
- AMICIA: Don't drop the torch!

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:19.526
As long as you have it,
they can't hurt you!

00:36:19.567 --> 00:36:20.995
- MAN: What do they want with me?

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.390
- AMICIA: Come to us.
We have to go back up.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.110
The sun will protect us.

00:36:26.201 --> 00:36:28.402
- LUCAS: Calm down.
You're safe in the light.

00:36:28.469 --> 00:36:29.739
- MAN: Alright.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.944
Where... where do they come from?

00:36:35.899 --> 00:36:37.796
- LUCAS: There's more coming.
- AMICIA: A lot more.

00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:39.091
Keep moving!

00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:40.989
- MAN: There're too many!

00:36:40.526 --> 00:36:43.326
- LUCAS: Don't stop!

00:36:41.622 --> 00:36:44.011
- AMICIA: Ignore them! Keep moving!

00:36:45.093 --> 00:36:46.093
- MAN: Yes.

(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

00:36:59.397 --> 00:37:00.719
- AMICIA: You see a way out?

00:37:00.746 --> 00:37:03.146
- LUCAS: I don't know.
It's too dark!

00:37:03.264 --> 00:37:04.602
Come! Quick!

00:37:04.668 --> 00:37:06.188

No, no!

- LUCAS: We're done!
- AMICIA: No.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.030
We've got light and we're safe for now.

00:37:19.758 --> 00:37:21.649
We're safe. We're safe.

00:37:22.245 --> 00:37:23.245
Calm down.

00:37:24.723 --> 00:37:25.916
Keep hold of me.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.927
- LUCAS: You think we can get out of this?

00:37:27.306 --> 00:37:28.641
- AMICIA: We must!

00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:30.201
Let's go carefully.

00:37:31.168 --> 00:37:32.168
I knew it!

00:37:32.425 --> 00:37:33.777
I told you they were here.

00:37:33.857 --> 00:37:36.191
- LUCAS: There're millions of them.

00:37:36.398 --> 00:37:39.094
How? How can that be so many already?

00:37:39.108 --> 00:37:41.708
- AMICIA: Hugo... They're here for him.

00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:48.530
Yes... That'll hold.

00:37:50.088 --> 00:37:52.222
- LUCAS: Look! They're climbing!

00:37:51.967 --> 00:37:53.647
- AMICIA: What? How??

00:37:53.847 --> 00:37:55.527
- LUCAS: This is so bad.

00:37:55.103 --> 00:37:59.574
- AMICIA: We get to that tower,
get Vaudin, bring him back to Hugo and leave.

00:38:02.568 --> 00:38:05.372
- LUCAS: My materials. I lost all of it in the fall.

00:38:05.439 --> 00:38:06.880
- AMICIA: We'll do without.

00:38:06.537 --> 00:38:09.403
- LUCAS: Yes. Please don't drop that torch.

00:38:14.466 --> 00:38:16.119
- AMICIA: I think we can climb that wall.

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:18.026
But I'll need my hands free.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.689
No choice.

00:38:20.729 --> 00:38:24.249
- LUCAS: I can't believe
we're leaving the torch behind.

00:38:28.428 --> 00:38:30.108
- AMICIA: Nasty filth!

00:38:29.635 --> 00:38:30.626
- LUCAS: What do we do?

00:38:30.667 --> 00:38:32.544
- AMICIA: Let's use the stick.

00:38:32.624 --> 00:38:34.304
- LUCAS: It'll burn fast.

00:38:36.206 --> 00:38:37.517
- AMICIA: We'll keep a straight line.

00:38:37.542 --> 00:38:39.408
- LUCAS: Yes. Very straight!

00:38:42.889 --> 00:38:44.329
- AMICIA: Lucas...

00:38:44.608 --> 00:38:46.128
When night comes...

00:38:45.653 --> 00:38:46.658
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:38:46.764 --> 00:38:49.431
Nothing will stop them from getting out.

00:39:03.143 --> 00:39:04.914
We <i>really</i> must get to higher ground.

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:07.034
- AMICIA: Fire's doing alright.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.110
For now.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.290
- LUCAS: For now?

00:39:13.287 --> 00:39:15.403
Good. One brazier at a time.

00:39:15.457 --> 00:39:17.665
- AMICIA: We can make it.
We're making it!

00:39:17.705 --> 00:39:19.439
- LUCAS: There's a ladder.

00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:30.209
- AMICIA: The light doesn't reach the ladder.

00:39:29.643 --> 00:39:31.336
- LUCAS: The lock on that chain looks weak.

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.922
- AMICIA: I see it.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.420
- LUCAS: Yes. Well done.

00:39:43.491 --> 00:39:45.225
- AMICIA: Let's go. Quick.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.630
Higher ground.

00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:54.032
That's better.

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:54.931
- LUCAS: I...

00:39:55.295 --> 00:39:56.799
...need to take a breath.

00:39:56.615 --> 00:39:59.524
- AMICIA: Breathe fast.
I don't know how long it's gonna last.

00:40:07.368 --> 00:40:08.307
- LUCAS: Really?

00:40:08.347 --> 00:40:09.347
A beam?

00:40:09.445 --> 00:40:11.311
- AMICIA: It's the only way.

00:40:12.173 --> 00:40:13.125
Right.

00:40:13.152 --> 00:40:14.152
Steady.

00:40:13.853 --> 00:40:15.053
- LUCAS: Wow...

00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:16.622
Alright.

00:40:16.323 --> 00:40:18.056
- AMICIA: Just don't rush.

00:40:18.914 --> 00:40:19.914
- LUCAS: Ah!

00:40:19.706 --> 00:40:20.986
- AMICIA: Lucas!

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:22.839
- LUCAS: I knew it!

00:40:22.364 --> 00:40:24.097
- AMICIA: Are you alright?

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.427
- LUCAS: No, I'm surrounded!

00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:27.968
- AMICIA: The ladder.
Get to higher ground. Quick!

00:40:27.427 --> 00:40:30.481
- LUCAS: Yes!
Of course it has to happen to me.

00:40:34.326 --> 00:40:35.948
I... I need help!

00:40:36.054 --> 00:40:37.644
They're coming after me.

00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:40.049
- AMICIA: Stay calm. You're fine for now.

00:40:39.825 --> 00:40:41.185
- LUCAS: For now?

00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:43.803
- AMICIA: I won't let you down.
You know it.

00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:07.386
Good. That'll do.

00:41:14.958 --> 00:41:15.998
There you go.

00:41:15.937 --> 00:41:17.109
- LUCAS: Thank you!

00:41:17.149 --> 00:41:20.628
I'll try to join you.
I'll need a stick to get across.

00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:23.181
Alright.

00:41:23.308 --> 00:41:26.482
Be fast. Be brave.
And don't fall this time.

00:41:26.578 --> 00:41:28.577
- AMICIA: You can do it.
Don't panic.

00:41:28.641 --> 00:41:30.441
- LUCAS: Too late for that!

00:41:34.485 --> 00:41:35.925
That was horrible.

00:41:36.391 --> 00:41:37.391
Thank you.

00:41:37.169 --> 00:41:39.454
- AMICIA: Please, stop giving cold sweat.

00:41:39.486 --> 00:41:40.846
Let's keep going.

00:41:46.155 --> 00:41:47.822
We're getting closer to sunlight.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.837
- LUCAS: Maybe we'll get out
closer to that tower.

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:53.858
I can't wait to hear
Magister Vaudin's plan about this.

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:55.648
- AMICIA: It better be a damn good plan.

00:41:55.712 --> 00:41:57.312
- LUCAS: It will be.

00:42:08.135 --> 00:42:09.575
- AMICIA: Oh no...

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.284
- LUCAS: We're going down again?

00:42:10.436 --> 00:42:11.796
- AMICIA: We are.

00:42:11.341 --> 00:42:13.021
- LUCAS: It's a joke!

00:42:12.722 --> 00:42:13.762
- AMICIA: No.

00:42:13.865 --> 00:42:17.277
And Hugo's condition gets worse
with every second we spend here.

00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:20.509
- LUCAS: Your Mother's with him.
He should be fine.

00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:28.701
No rats.

00:42:28.526 --> 00:42:31.081
- AMICIA: No.
But they were here not long ago.

00:42:31.145 --> 00:42:32.825
Look at these bodies.

00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:33.567
- LUCAS: Fresh.

00:42:33.161 --> 00:42:35.294
- AMICIA: They're close. Careful.

00:42:46.222 --> 00:42:47.222
Wow...

00:42:47.714 --> 00:42:48.983
What is that?

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.754
- LUCAS: Rails in the walls.

00:42:50.825 --> 00:42:52.316
It looks like an elevator.

00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:54.021
It could be a way out.

00:42:58.206 --> 00:42:59.646
- AMICIA: Lucas...

00:42:59.698 --> 00:43:00.825
What is that thing?

00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:02.246
- LUCAS: I've read about this.

00:43:02.294 --> 00:43:03.565
It's an elephant.

00:43:03.629 --> 00:43:06.609
From Africa.
Roman used it in joined circus games.

00:43:06.657 --> 00:43:08.337
- AMICIA: It's enormous!

00:43:08.796 --> 00:43:10.304
Look at its... teeth.

00:43:10.399 --> 00:43:11.716
- LUCAS: This is...

00:43:11.828 --> 00:43:13.800
It's real...
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:18.431
There's enough bones around.
Let's get out of here.

00:43:25.538 --> 00:43:26.578
That smell...

00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:28.639
- LUCAS: I know. It's... sulfur.

00:43:30.008 --> 00:43:31.008
A crank.

00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:33.001
- AMICIA: Let's see what it does.

00:43:33.679 --> 00:43:35.359
I'm going to need you.

00:43:34.774 --> 00:43:35.894
- LUCAS: Sure.

00:43:39.377 --> 00:43:40.377
Huh...

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:41.584
Wow...

00:43:43.054 --> 00:43:45.308
- AMICIA: Oh no...
Do you hear that?

00:43:44.737 --> 00:43:46.603
- LUCAS: Oh no... Please no!

00:43:46.818 --> 00:43:49.960
- AMICIA: Look how many there are...
We're stuck, Lucas.

00:43:49.993 --> 00:43:51.193
- LUCAS: No no.

00:43:51.438 --> 00:43:54.136
Look at the platform.
The brazier...

00:43:54.168 --> 00:43:56.653
It looks big enough to light the whole room.

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:59.050
- AMICIA: How do we set it on fire?

00:43:58.404 --> 00:43:59.737
- LUCAS: I don't know.

00:43:59.786 --> 00:44:02.441
Saltpetre, sulfur, alcohol...

00:44:02.505 --> 00:44:04.185
Whatever we can find.

00:44:04.238 --> 00:44:08.782
- AMICIA: Fine. These roofs are opened now.
Maybe we'll find something.

00:44:12.509 --> 00:44:13.509
Meatstock.

00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:16.969
- LUCAS: We need a preservative
like... alcohol.

00:44:17.256 --> 00:44:18.856
Maybe in that chest.

00:44:18.399 --> 00:44:21.830
- AMICIA: Alright. Let's try to keep
these rats occupied first.

00:44:24.924 --> 00:44:27.458
- LUCAS: Good. But it won't be enough.

00:44:29.286 --> 00:44:30.286
Don't fall.

00:44:30.191 --> 00:44:31.991
- AMICIA: Thank you, Lucas.

00:44:41.771 --> 00:44:43.211
They'll like this.

00:44:51.102 --> 00:44:52.782
- LUCAS: It looks safe.

00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:53.991
- AMICIA: Good. Let's get to that chest.

00:44:53.801 --> 00:44:58.089
- LUCAS: They still look like
they haven't eaten in a million years.

00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:03.000
So? What's in it?

00:45:03.607 --> 00:45:05.341
- AMICIA: Alcohol bottles.

00:45:04.861 --> 00:45:06.595
- LUCAS: Yes! That's good!

00:45:06.656 --> 00:45:08.336
Very good. Come back.

00:45:20.192 --> 00:45:21.192
Alright.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.938
We need a second element...

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:25.052
...then we'll craft an Ignifer.

00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:26.097
Remember?

00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:27.315
- AMICIA: Ignifer.

00:45:27.194 --> 00:45:28.874
I've forgot about this.

00:45:28.924 --> 00:45:31.932
Let's check that other one.
That's sulfur, right?

00:45:32.601 --> 00:45:35.109
- LUCAS: Yes.
Some spilled on these planks.

00:45:35.189 --> 00:45:37.722
The chest up there might contain more.

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.601
Fresh sulfur would be perfect.

00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:41.566
- AMICIA: Let's get up there.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:49.232
A crank.
There's an elevator.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.850
Lucas, that's your job.

00:45:53.503 --> 00:45:55.023
- LUCAS: Naturally.

00:45:55.222 --> 00:46:04.317
(CRANKING NOISE)

00:46:04.537 --> 00:46:05.537
I'm holding.

00:46:07.929 --> 00:46:09.795
- AMICIA: We're losing time.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.240
- LUCAS: On your go.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.304
- AMICIA: You can let go now.

00:46:21.672 --> 00:46:23.192
- LUCAS: Of course.

00:46:23.898 --> 00:46:26.637
- AMICIA: We need to move faster.
I'm worried about Hugo.

00:46:26.685 --> 00:46:29.663
- LUCAS: The tower is not that far.
As soon as we find Vaudin, he'll...

00:46:29.712 --> 00:46:31.695
- AMICIA: We don't even know if he's in there.

00:46:31.712 --> 00:46:32.962
And with the rats...

00:46:32.979 --> 00:46:34.659
And those mercenaries...

00:46:34.471 --> 00:46:35.511
- LUCAS: Hey!

00:46:35.896 --> 00:46:37.496
One thing at a time.

00:46:37.118 --> 00:46:38.238
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:40.589
Good.

00:46:41.345 --> 00:46:42.345
- LUCAS: So?

00:46:42.393 --> 00:46:43.513
Find anything?

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.617
- AMICIA: You were right.
It's sulfur.

00:46:46.198 --> 00:46:47.118
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:46:47.181 --> 00:46:49.086
Now that is very good news.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.610
Good.
We have sulfur and alcohol.

00:46:52.642 --> 00:46:55.055
It's one of the best basics for an Ignifer.

00:46:55.072 --> 00:46:56.352
Highly reactive.

00:46:56.591 --> 00:46:58.031
Mix them together.

00:46:57.654 --> 00:46:58.860
- AMICIA: Ignifer...

00:46:58.908 --> 00:47:00.348
I love that thing.

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:01.899
- LUCAS: It's a life-saver.

00:47:05.028 --> 00:47:06.228
- AMICIA: Done.

00:47:05.831 --> 00:47:08.057
- LUCAS: Shoot it at those embers
with your sling and...

00:47:08.121 --> 00:47:09.930
Well, hope that it works.

00:47:15.323 --> 00:47:17.165
- AMICIA: Huh... What the hell?

00:47:15.561 --> 00:47:16.601
- LUCAS: Wow.

00:47:17.387 --> 00:47:19.482
That was highly reactive, indeed.

00:47:19.514 --> 00:47:22.625
- AMICIA: Thanks, Lucas.
That Ignifer will be more than useful.

00:47:22.652 --> 00:47:25.386
Now, let's try to get that platform down.

00:47:24.738 --> 00:47:26.531
- LUCAS: I think I've seen
other cranks around.

00:47:26.595 --> 00:47:28.462
- AMICIA: We'll have a look.

00:47:39.769 --> 00:47:42.778
- LUCAS: There're our cranks.
Up there. Under the arches.

00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:44.224
- AMICIA: Yes. What now?

00:47:44.271 --> 00:47:46.993
- LUCAS: Cages...
They had other pieces in there.

00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:50.033
- AMICIA: Whatever.
Let's slide this place out.

00:48:05.307 --> 00:48:06.987
There're still rats left.

00:48:07.612 --> 00:48:09.056
- LUCAS: That clay pot you have...

00:48:09.151 --> 00:48:12.797
It could concentrate the effect
of an Ignifer and release it on impact.

00:48:12.861 --> 00:48:13.781
Go on. Try.

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:15.829
- AMICIA: Let's hope it works.

00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:17.691
It's done.

00:48:17.772 --> 00:48:19.486
- LUCAS: Throw it to make a brief fire.

00:48:19.518 --> 00:48:20.756
It'll get us across.

00:48:20.804 --> 00:48:22.604
But we'll have to be quick.

00:48:23.301 --> 00:48:24.421
- AMICIA: Now!

00:48:24.031 --> 00:48:25.711
- LUCAS: Yes... Move.

00:48:25.634 --> 00:48:27.767
- AMICIA: That was a great idea.

00:48:27.116 --> 00:48:29.916
- LUCAS: Pretty easy. You just need a pot.

00:49:02.923 --> 00:49:07.213
- AMICIA: Alright.
Let's... move... this... beast.

00:49:10.558 --> 00:49:12.238
That thing is too heavy.

00:49:11.939 --> 00:49:14.012
- LUCAS: That's what the crank
on the other side is for.

00:49:14.044 --> 00:49:15.644
You need two people.

00:49:15.299 --> 00:49:18.333
- AMICIA: Alright, you stay there.
I'll go man that other one.

00:49:18.032 --> 00:49:20.099
- LUCAS: I'll wait for your go.

00:49:23.512 --> 00:49:25.032
This is it, Amicia.

00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:26.461
- AMICIA: Hopefully.

00:49:28.569 --> 00:49:33.113
- AMICIA: As someone had told me
the world was about to collapse again.

00:49:40.341 --> 00:49:41.826
So many jars.

00:49:42.477 --> 00:49:45.377
Probably wine
for the spectators of the arena.

00:49:45.627 --> 00:49:47.307
Some things never change.

00:49:52.167 --> 00:49:53.770
I'll bring help, Hugo.

00:49:53.786 --> 00:49:55.466
I'll find this Vaudin.

00:49:55.548 --> 00:49:58.757
But you have to hold on...
I'm doing my best.

00:50:38.063 --> 00:50:39.423
To the crank now.

00:50:39.317 --> 00:50:41.459
Time to get that lift down
and get the hell out of here.

00:50:41.523 --> 00:50:43.203
Alright, Lucas.
I'm there.

00:50:43.301 --> 00:50:45.501
- LUCAS: I'm waiting for your go.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:02.570
- AMICIA: It's working!

00:51:02.017 --> 00:51:03.884
- LUCAS: I can't believe it!

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.920
- AMICIA: Thank the Lord!

00:51:10.288 --> 00:51:11.288
This is it!

00:51:11.351 --> 00:51:13.031
- LUCAS: On your word.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:14.950
- AMICIA: Go!

00:51:14.623 --> 00:51:18.612
- LUCAS: Erm... You hear that?
That might be the brake breaking.

00:51:18.636 --> 00:51:21.528
- AMICIA: Let's get to the lift.
Quick!

00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:22.871
Wow.

00:51:22.696 --> 00:51:24.268
- LUCAS: (EXHALES) Steady.

00:51:24.301 --> 00:51:26.901
- AMICIA: (EXHALES)
How did we do this?

00:51:27.044 --> 00:51:28.202
- LUCAS: With...

00:51:28.234 --> 00:51:30.701
...exceptional skills and resilience.

00:51:32.711 --> 00:51:34.311
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.090
It's starting again.

00:51:37.699 --> 00:51:39.766
Do you realise what that means?

00:51:39.287 --> 00:51:40.407
- LUCAS: I do.

00:51:41.027 --> 00:51:43.361
But we've been through this before.

00:51:42.646 --> 00:51:44.662
- AMICIA: You saw how they charged us.

00:51:44.726 --> 00:51:46.155
The way they move.

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:49.103
They're faster, more agile,
more intelligent.

00:51:49.137 --> 00:51:50.817
- LUCAS: But we made it.

00:51:50.248 --> 00:51:51.608
- AMICIA: Barely.

00:51:51.169 --> 00:51:53.068
- LUCAS: Let's find Magiter Vaudin.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.606
With the Order by our side...

00:51:54.654 --> 00:51:57.387
...we won't have to
face this alone anymore.

00:51:56.654 --> 00:51:59.454
- AMICIA: I really hope that you're right.

00:52:15.442 --> 00:52:17.975
Please tell me
we didn't stray from it.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.755
Yes! The tower!

00:52:23.343 --> 00:52:25.543
- LUCAS: We got a bit closer, no?

00:52:24.819 --> 00:52:26.099
- AMICIA: A bit.

00:52:26.225 --> 00:52:27.745
But I'll take that.

00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:37.025
I see no sign of those mercenaries.

00:52:36.815 --> 00:52:39.354
- LUCAS: Let's hope
it doesn't mean they found him.

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:40.155
- AMICIA: Let's just hurry.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.874
- LUCAS: This place actually
seemed pretty nice.

00:52:46.097 --> 00:52:48.163
- AMICIA: Before <i>the Bite</i>? Yes.

00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:50.641
- LUCAS: A vegetable garden.

00:52:50.694 --> 00:52:52.054
Oh, look at that!

00:52:54.454 --> 00:52:56.478
Amicia, you should come see this.

00:52:56.526 --> 00:52:58.206
I think you'll like it.

00:52:59.186 --> 00:53:01.853
- AMICIA: Hey...
What are you doing here?

00:53:01.282 --> 00:53:03.603
- LUCAS: Whoever planted it won't see it grow.

00:53:03.175 --> 00:53:05.042
- AMICIA: Hugo will love it.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.800
I'll keep it there.

00:53:06.999 --> 00:53:07.999
Like before.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.600
- LUCAS: It suits you.

00:53:08.872 --> 00:53:10.739
- AMICIA: Well... Thank you!

00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:12.248
Let's keep going.

00:53:20.745 --> 00:53:22.427
We're getting really close to the tower.

00:53:22.507 --> 00:53:23.824
One last push.

00:53:24.793 --> 00:53:27.596
This thing is big.
He has to be in there.

00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:29.885
- LUCAS: It looks like
the safest place anyway.

00:53:29.505 --> 00:53:31.615
- AMICIA: If the Order still has that power...

00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:33.711
...maybe they could save Hugo.

00:53:42.343 --> 00:53:45.327
- SOLDIER 1: So, we wait
until Arnaud arrives to get him out.

00:53:45.391 --> 00:53:47.994
Tell your men to stand ready
to storm the tower.

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.774
- SOLDIER 2: Didn't you hear?
We have men missing.

00:53:49.807 --> 00:53:52.203
Something's going on here.
Let's go get the others after this.

00:53:52.283 --> 00:53:54.149
And leave this bloody place.

00:53:54.188 --> 00:53:55.944
- SOLDIER 1: We wait for Arnaud.

00:53:55.993 --> 00:53:57.113
It's an order.

00:53:56.977 --> 00:53:59.110
- SOLDIER 2: Alright. Your call.

00:53:58.821 --> 00:54:01.088
- LUCAS: He's really in the tower.

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.620
- LUCAS: We're here.

00:58:04.972 --> 00:58:06.652
I think we're safe now.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:07.870
You did great.

00:58:09.775 --> 00:58:10.815
What's wrong?

00:58:12.712 --> 00:58:14.512
Vaudin's somewhere in here.

00:58:14.585 --> 00:58:15.585
We did it.

00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:22.425
- AMICIA: Those last months on the road...

00:58:22.937 --> 00:58:25.270
After all that happened in Guyenne.

00:58:26.512 --> 00:58:30.224
Hugo was always worry
that it would start all over again.

00:58:31.658 --> 00:58:32.659
But...

00:58:32.707 --> 00:58:35.136
Everything was... so nice.

00:58:35.247 --> 00:58:36.247
And quiet.

00:58:36.292 --> 00:58:37.292
A-And...

00:58:37.403 --> 00:58:39.307
So I told him...

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:42.307
...that maybe it was... over.

00:58:42.831 --> 00:58:44.815
That the worse was behind.

00:58:45.801 --> 00:58:47.734
- LUCAS: We all hoped it was.

00:58:48.279 --> 00:58:50.288
- AMICIA: What am I gonna tell him now?

00:58:50.336 --> 00:58:52.016
That the rats are back?

00:58:52.193 --> 00:58:54.460
That <i>the Bite</i> has killed hundreds?

00:58:55.127 --> 00:58:59.367
And this new home
that he likes is already dying.

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:01.720
I'm not ready for this...

00:59:01.847 --> 00:59:04.380
- LUCAS: No one could be ready for this.

00:59:05.449 --> 00:59:07.940
But soon we won't
be alone in this anymore.

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.820
We'll have the best alchemist by our side.

00:59:14.339 --> 00:59:15.339
Good?

00:59:16.704 --> 00:59:17.904
- AMICIA: Good.

00:59:20.804 --> 00:59:22.244
- LUCAS: Now look.

00:59:23.434 --> 00:59:24.954
A real Order lodge.

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:32.571
- AMICIA: Let's get this
Magister Vaudin to Hugo.

00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:40.149
- LUCAS: That's an entrance hall.

00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:42.509
- AMICIA: How do we get upstairs?

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:43.370
- LUCAS: I see no door.

00:59:43.389 --> 00:59:45.189
But these sort of iron bells...

00:59:45.613 --> 00:59:46.613
Look.

00:59:46.661 --> 00:59:48.341
They bear planet symbols.

00:59:48.759 --> 00:59:51.631
And here, the Sun sits in their centre.

00:59:52.366 --> 00:59:54.899
The order of the planets is not right.

00:59:54.128 --> 00:59:56.795
- AMICIA: How does the whole thing work?

00:59:57.643 --> 01:00:00.843
- LUCAS: There're locks
for a key under each bell.

01:00:01.088 --> 01:00:02.768
It's one big mechanism.

01:00:02.606 --> 01:00:05.506
- AMICIA: But...
we don't have a key, so...?

01:00:04.598 --> 01:00:07.125
- LUCAS: I think the key makes each bell pivot...

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:09.103
But your sling may do the trick.

01:00:09.135 --> 01:00:10.815
Let's try from the left.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.740
- AMICIA: Alright.

01:00:11.094 --> 01:00:13.427
- LUCAS: From left to right,
the correct order is...

01:00:13.475 --> 01:00:17.420
Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, and Mercury.

01:00:17.506 --> 01:00:19.632
Jupiter's symbol looks like a <i>"Z"</i>

01:00:19.696 --> 01:00:20.816
Like for <i>Zeus</i>.

01:00:24.057 --> 01:00:25.177
- AMICIA: <i>"Z"</i>.

01:00:30.946 --> 01:00:32.813
- LUCAS: That's it! Jupiter.

01:00:32.867 --> 01:00:34.547
- AMICIA: What's next?

01:00:34.427 --> 01:00:37.664
- LUCAS: To Jupiter's right is Mars,
the <i>God of War</i>.

01:00:37.696 --> 01:00:39.774
It's a shield crossed by a spear.

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.549
- AMICIA: Spear. Shield.

01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:43.023
- LUCAS: Mars should be a circle...

01:00:43.047 --> 01:00:44.780
- AMICIA: Mars. That's it.

01:00:43.842 --> 01:00:46.905
- LUCAS: Now, Venus is the first
to the right of the Sun.

01:00:46.937 --> 01:00:48.804
It's shaped like a necklace.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:58.236
Look for a circle
with a line going down.

01:00:59.388 --> 01:01:01.521
- AMICIA: I think this is Venus.

01:01:00.159 --> 01:01:02.359
- LUCAS: The last one is Mercury.

01:01:01.834 --> 01:01:03.114
<i>God of Commerce</i>.

01:01:03.136 --> 01:01:06.080
He carries a staff
with two snakes intertwined.

01:01:08.311 --> 01:01:11.111
Mercury's symbol is
two snakes intertwined.

01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:14.693
- AMICIA: And done!
That's all of them I think.

01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:15.519
- LUCAS: Yes! Oh look!

01:01:15.919 --> 01:01:17.359
That moves a door.

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.193
It's so (INAUDIBLE)

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:22.033
- AMICIA: Good work.
Let's find this Magister.

01:01:51.303 --> 01:01:52.583
Magister Vaudin?

01:01:52.493 --> 01:01:54.013
I'm Amicia de Rune.

01:01:53.525 --> 01:01:55.205
- VAUDIN: The daughter.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.016
That explains why
those brutes downstairs are so quiet.

01:02:01.564 --> 01:02:02.844
The Order was...

01:02:02.977 --> 01:02:07.073
...quite impressed by the way
you put down the Inquisition in Guyenne.

01:02:07.817 --> 01:02:10.484
- AMICIA: Well...
I didn't have a choice.

01:02:09.214 --> 01:02:10.894
- VAUDIN: Not a choice...

01:02:10.826 --> 01:02:11.826
A calling.

01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:14.481
That of a Carrier's Protector.

01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:16.119
- AMICIA: A what?

01:02:16.947 --> 01:02:18.424
- VAUDIN: A protector.

01:02:18.488 --> 01:02:20.488
Your function among the Order.

01:02:20.805 --> 01:02:22.672
- AMICIA: Wait... I'm not...

01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:24.342
- VAUNDIN: And you are...?

01:02:24.111 --> 01:02:26.778
- LUCAS: I'm Lucas.
I'm an alchemist too.

01:02:26.706 --> 01:02:28.386
- VAUDIN: An apprentice.

01:02:28.421 --> 01:02:31.321
Does your Magistra know
you entitle yourself?

01:02:31.103 --> 01:02:32.452
- AMICIA: Who cares??

01:02:32.484 --> 01:02:34.854
The Macula's woken up again.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.742
My brother needs your help
and the rats are already there!

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.794
- VAUDIN: Control your flame, Protector.

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.230
Others have burnt in it.

01:02:44.483 --> 01:02:45.483
Take my bag.

01:02:47.972 --> 01:02:50.069
Let's go see that Carrier.

01:03:00.987 --> 01:03:01.987
(DOOR OPENS)

01:03:03.051 --> 01:03:04.918
- BÉATRICE: Magister Vaudin.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.620
- VAUDIN: Where is he?

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:06.810
- BÉATRICE: Upstairs.

01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:13.267
- AMICIA: How are you doing?

01:03:13.798 --> 01:03:15.318
- HUGO: I'm scared.

01:03:17.022 --> 01:03:19.822
- BÉATRICE: Hugo, this is Magister Vaudin.

01:03:19.356 --> 01:03:20.476
- HUGO: Hello.

01:03:21.737 --> 01:03:24.270
- VAUDIN: We should start immediately.

01:03:25.947 --> 01:03:27.547
I will need silence.

01:03:28.802 --> 01:03:30.322
- AMICIA: Mother...

01:03:29.627 --> 01:03:31.427
- BÉATRICE: I'll handle it.
