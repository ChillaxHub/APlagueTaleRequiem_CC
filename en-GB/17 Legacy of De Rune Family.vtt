- SOPHIA: Of course, I wouldn't miss this.

00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:45.897
Careful, I smell like a goat.

00:01:46.018 --> 00:01:49.090

- AMICIA: Walking... Fixing the house...

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:30.934
Trying to exhaust myself.

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:32.695
- SOPHIA: Does it work?

00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:33.388
- AMICIA: It's...

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:34.916
...better.

00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:36.192
Yes...

00:02:35.832 --> 00:02:37.032
- SOPHIA: Good.

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:39.338

- AMICIA: I'm fine, Sophia.

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:43.628
It's been a year.

00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.001
- SOPHIA: Already?

00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:46.001

How's the business going?

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:48.735
- SOPHIA: Good.

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:49.801
Doing more...

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.696
...<i>legal</i> trading these days.

00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:53.711

00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:56.511
- SOPHIA: Well... I just want to live longer.

00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:57.172
- AMICIA: Really?

00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:59.532
- SOPHIA: I like a quiet sea
better than a storm.

00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:02.196
Speaking of which, we'll depart tomorrow.

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.229
- AMICIA: Great.

00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:04.164

- SOPHIA: Is our alchemist coming?

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:08.385
- AMICIA: Lucas?

00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:09.452
Oh... no...

00:03:09.892 --> 00:03:11.572
He's still on the road.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.599
Studying.

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.079
- SOPHIA: All by himself?

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:15.325
They grow up so fast.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:16.805
- AMICIA: He needed this.

00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:21.240
- SOPHIA: Whew... Getting chilly.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.960
- AMICIA: Let's pick up the pace a bit.

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:42.769
- SOPHIA: So... do you know
where we can put you ashore?

00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.036
- AMICIA: Not yet...

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:46.689
But I think I'll know
when I come across the signs.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.715
- SOPHIA: Of the Macula?

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:48.587
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.177
It leaves... marks on things and people.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:53.998
I think...

00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:57.899
...I can find where the next Carrier
and Protector will rise.

00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:00.006
- SOPHIA: The next plague.

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.483
- AMICIA: I want just set the path for them.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:03.963
Like Aelia did for us.

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:06.537
- SOPHIA: No use telling you just to rest then.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.523
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES) None.

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.381
- SOPHIA: Fine.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:13.215
Ah...

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:14.881
It smells so good.

00:04:15.228 --> 00:04:16.508
And the quiet...

00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:17.574
- AMICIA: Yes...

00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:18.907
I'll miss it.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.955
- SOPHIA: Getting there.

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:50.197
(HORSE SNORES)

00:04:50.468 --> 00:04:52.695
Boys, this is Amicia.

00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:53.935
Be kind to her.

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:55.655
It's her special day.

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.139
- AMICIA: Hi.

00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:17.084
Can you give me some time?

00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:18.858
I have one last thing to do.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.523
- SOPHIA: Take as much as you want.

00:05:21.107 --> 00:05:23.440
My back's still hurt from the road.

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:25.266
- AMICIA: No storm coming?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.100
- SOPHIA: You're the only one I see.

00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:30.407
- AMICIA: I won't take too long.

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:39.577
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
It's going to be alright.

00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:19.458
The sea will look so flat compared to this.

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:53.607
(MAIN THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:55.740

(MAIN THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:07:37.443 --> 00:07:38.443

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:40.683
I'm coming in.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.410
It's going to be alright.

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.088
Hey.

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:59.604
They didn't used to come here before.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.023
I always knew you'd be good
at making friends.

00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:25.495
I wasn't sure I was ready.

00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:26.695
But...

00:09:26.588 --> 00:09:27.970
Sophia's here.

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:40.379
I'm sorry.

00:09:43.778 --> 00:09:45.658
Why is it so hard?

00:09:56.703 --> 00:09:58.570
We never backed down, right?

00:10:00.518 --> 00:10:01.518
We held...

00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:14.443
May this earth remember
how much you loved it.

00:10:16.517 --> 00:10:17.957
May it remember...

00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:21.090
...all you gave to protect it.

00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:39.850
I remember.

00:10:45.297 --> 00:10:47.430
And I won't let it be forgotten.
