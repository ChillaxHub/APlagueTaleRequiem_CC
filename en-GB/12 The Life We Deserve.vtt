00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:40.588
XII - THE LIFE WE DESERVE

00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:48.214
- SOPHIA: Things are not getting better.

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:53.028
Although it seems
they've figured the critters out already.

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.095
- AMICIA: Others did before
and died anyway.

00:00:56.893 --> 00:00:58.626
It's too late, we must go.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.029
- HUGO: But...

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.269
- AMICIA: It's not just about
this island anymore, Hugo.

00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:07.927
We need to leave
or we'll doomed everything.

00:01:28.604 --> 00:01:30.404
Careful with the drop here.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.890
- HUGO: Yes.

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:34.243
Oh...

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.227
He's dead.

00:01:38.142 --> 00:01:40.208
- AMICIA: No choice... Sorry...

00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:41.918
- HUGO: Yes... Sorry...

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.001
- AMICIA: Come, wel'll cross.

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:50.983
Now we do things safe and slow.

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:52.792
No taking stupid risks.

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:56.311
Hugo, if you feel funny,
tell us right away.

00:01:56.338 --> 00:01:57.538
- HUGO: I will.

00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.874
- SOPHIA: Can't wait to leave this rock.

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.408
- AMICIA: Alright, the harbour, come.

00:02:04.953 --> 00:02:06.633
- SOLDIER: Hey! My lady!

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.320
- SOPHIA: What is it now?

00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.481
- SOLDIER: You're the Countess' guest, aren't you?

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:14.125
Are you hurt?

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:16.256
- AMICIA: No...

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:20.092
- SOLDIER: We have orders...
to escort you safely to the palace.

00:02:19.683 --> 00:02:22.116
- AMICIA: Actually... we were about to leave...

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:23.717
- SOLDIER: You have guests.

00:02:23.504 --> 00:02:24.864
- AMICIA: Guests?
Who?

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.796
- SOLDIER: Your mother, and a boy.

00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:29.198
- AMICIA: Of course...

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.197
- HUGO: Do you think she's going to scold us?

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.902
- AMICIA: I don't know... I...

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:38.000
- HUGO: We should go see her.

00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:39.532
It's been a long time.

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:42.136
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:45.112
We can't run away from this, I guess.

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:47.953
- SOPHIA: Wow... Look at the two of you.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.734
Only a mum can have such power over someone.

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:53.874
Alright, you know what...

00:02:54.327 --> 00:02:56.891
I'll head to the harbour and prepare the boat.

00:02:56.574 --> 00:02:58.641
You join me as soon as you can.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.260
- AMICIA: Take this.

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.214
Whatever happens...
Keep this flame alive, alright?

00:03:05.294 --> 00:03:07.502
- HUGO: Yes. Be careful.

00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:11.021
- SOPHIA: Don't worry.
I've learnt from both of you.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.077
- AMICIA: Lead the way then.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.598
- HUGO: What will we tell her?

00:03:20.503 --> 00:03:22.103
- AMICIA: The truth.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.501
We found what we came for.

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:25.218
And I'm the one to blame.

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.686
- HUGO: I'll defend you.

00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:27.928
- AMICIA: My hero.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.669 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Hurry!
Move before they come back.

00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.574
- AMICIA: Is the palace going to hold, sir?

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.686
- SOLDIER: For now.

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:36.274
The Count opened that gates to the people.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.549
But there're so many dead and wounded.

00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:39.890
- AMICIA: We've seen that.

00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:47.067
- SOLDIER: Careful. Stay back.

00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:49.446
- HUGO: It's like the one we saw...

00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:50.482
The broken one.

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.381
- AMICIA: Shh... Yes.

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:54.247
Where did they get it?

00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:56.420
- SOLDIER: You're safe
as long as you stay inside this light.

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.049
But outside, without light.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.410
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:00.863
We know.

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:02.382
- SOLDIER: Anyway, you're safe now.

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:09.016
- AMICIA: Are you not planning to evacuate?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.060
- SOLDIER: Not yet.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.947
Not until we've got everybody regrouped.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:20.894 position:20% line:20%
- MAN 1: Get to the bridge. Hold the line!

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:23.028 position:80% line:20%
- MAN 2: We need more fires
on the main road!

00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:26.188
- SOLDIER: Keep up the pace.
Keep these flames fed.

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.488
- HUGO: It looks like a war.

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:30.349 line:20%
- MAN 3: Come give me a hand with this!

00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:33.602 position:80% line:50%
- MAN 4: The rats are pushing on our east flank.
We need torches there!

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.134
- AMICIA: They should've evacuated.

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:38.106
- HUGO: Yes, no one can win against them.

00:04:37.056 --> 00:04:40.177 line:20%
- MAN 5: The cart stays here lady.
We need it to carry the wounded.

00:04:40.202 --> 00:04:41.633 line:20%
- WOMAN: Er... My belongings?

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:43.273 line:20%
- MAN 5: You can bring them inside.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.408 line:20%
- WOMAN: Alright... I understand. Good luck.

00:04:47.414 --> 00:04:51.356 line:20%
- MAN 6: Dig trenches along the ramparts
and fill them with tar. Keep 'em burning.

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:53.444 line:20%
Any breach could make the palace falls.

00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:55.931 line:20%
- MAN 7: And...
If the rats enter the palace?

00:04:55.967 --> 00:04:58.980 line:20%
- MAN 6: Then you're dead.
Keep them burning!

00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:00.541
- AMICIA: This is all in ...

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:04.943
- HUGO: Another one.

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.424
- SOLDIER: We've got wounded up here.

00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:14.724
It's not pretty.

00:05:15.344 --> 00:05:18.307
The... child... might want to look away.

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:20.014
- HUGO: I know blood.

00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:21.658
- AMICIA: Still, try not to look.

00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:26.465 position:20% line:20%
(COUGHING)

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:29.369 line:20%

(COUGHING)

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.077
- HUGO: They're the ones
who've been bitten.

00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:34.283
- AMICIA: Yes... it will soon spread.

00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:36.077
- WOMAN 2: It can't be!

00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:38.530
- MAN 9: It's over. Let him go.

00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:39.998
- WOMAN 2: No! No!

00:05:41.404 --> 00:05:52.239
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.480
- HUGO: Children...

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:12.108
- HUGO: This is... my fault.

00:06:12.148 --> 00:06:13.948
- AMICIA: Shhh... Please...

00:06:25.098 --> 00:06:27.510
- SOLDIER: Through there. Be safe.

00:06:27.538 --> 00:06:28.978
- AMICIA: You too.

00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:41.105
- HUGO: Mummy!

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:43.197
- LUCAS: You're here!

00:06:43.948 --> 00:06:46.148
- BÉATRICE: My God, you're alive.

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:49.329
- AMICIA: Mother...

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:50.495
- BÉATRICE: Come here.

00:06:51.238 --> 00:06:52.678
Please, come here.

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.209
- AMICIA: Mother...

00:06:54.653 --> 00:06:56.333
- BÉATRICE: How are you?

00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:57.874
Your head?

00:06:57.937 --> 00:07:00.137
- AMICIA: It's fine, don't worry.

00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:01.678
How did you find us?

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.994
- BÉATRICE: You left quite a trail behind you.

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.169
But tell me...

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.460
Is it the one?

00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:08.821
This island?

00:07:10.522 --> 00:07:12.148
- LUCAS: The one from your dream.

00:07:12.003 --> 00:07:14.701
- HUGO: There was another Carrier, like me.

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:16.426
- LUCAS: Another Carrier?

00:07:16.148 --> 00:07:17.268
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:19.407
Back in the Sixth Century.

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:21.772
A child called Basilius...

00:07:21.994 --> 00:07:23.969
We... found him... chained...

00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:27.087
In an Order prison
designed especially for him.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.476
- BÉATRICE: What?

00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:31.517
- AMICIA: I think they panicked
when he reached his last threshold.

00:07:31.947 --> 00:07:34.480
They took him away from his Protector.

00:07:34.923 --> 00:07:36.789
Locked him in there... to...

00:07:37.037 --> 00:07:39.260
Contempt what would happen next.

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:40.993
- LUCAS: A new plague?

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.607
In the Sixth Century, that's...

00:07:42.804 --> 00:07:45.004
- BÉATRICE: The Justinean plague.

00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:48.127
We knew it was connected to the Macula but...

00:07:48.643 --> 00:07:50.163
So it started here.

00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:51.945
With this Basilius...

00:07:51.652 --> 00:07:53.852
- HUGO: But it was not his fault.

00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.682
He was just... all alone and scared.

00:07:56.978 --> 00:07:58.098
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:07:58.475 --> 00:07:59.475
Mother...

00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:02.172
Magister Vaudin said Hugo was condemned.

00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:05.267
But this is what the Order believes.

00:08:05.565 --> 00:08:08.713
Based on their mistake in the past with Basilus.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.488
If he had his Protector...

00:08:10.977 --> 00:08:12.722
...like Hugo has us.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.460
I'm sure nothing would've happened.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.362
Think about it.

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:19.925
During the last months on the road...

00:08:19.962 --> 00:08:23.307
The times when it was quiet...
Everything was just fine.

00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:24.095
He was fine.

00:08:24.515 --> 00:08:25.941
- BÉATRICE: That's true.

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:29.327
- AMICIA: Something tells me
that if we settle down somewhere safe.

00:08:29.433 --> 00:08:31.233
And live there as a family.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.288
- BÉATRICE: Maybe the plague would stop.

00:08:34.064 --> 00:08:35.064
With time...

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.989
- AMICIA: It would stop getting worse.

00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:41.635
- BÉATRICE: Fear really clouded our minds, didn't it?

00:08:42.298 --> 00:08:43.978
Except yours, Protector.

00:08:44.312 --> 00:08:45.312
- HUGO: Yes.

00:08:46.703 --> 00:08:49.653
- BÉATRICE: Remember that house
we had on the mountain?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.240
We'll be great there.

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:53.267
- HUGO: We'll be big and tall.

00:08:54.631 --> 00:08:56.327
- SOLDIER: Sorry to interrupt.

00:08:56.063 --> 00:08:57.863
The Count wants to see you.

00:08:58.061 --> 00:08:59.101
- AMICIA: Me?

00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:00.295
Now?

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.929
But we're about to leave.

00:09:03.678 --> 00:09:06.016
- SOLDIER: He's the Count of Provence, my lady.

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:07.349
- BÉATRICE: Yes.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.167
We'll wait for you.

00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:12.415
For now we're safe in here
than outside anyway.

00:09:14.114 --> 00:09:16.181
- AMICIA: Fine, take me to him.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.840
- SOLDIER: Follow me.

00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:34.033
- AMICIA: Do you know
what the Count wants with me?

00:09:33.822 --> 00:09:34.942
- SOLDIER: No.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.362
- AMICIA: I thought he was be attending
to more urgent matters.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.467
- SOLDIER: Seeing you
must be an urgent matter.

00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:41.374
Act put dignity in his presence.

00:09:41.134 --> 00:09:42.654
These are dark times.

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:44.496
He's touched, like any of us.

00:09:44.352 --> 00:09:46.085
- AMICIA: Alright, I will.

00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:51.353
- VICTOR: The main gate is secure enough
for now but the western rampart is still weak.

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:55.039
If the rats enter through there
we won't be able to evacuate the wounded.

00:09:55.117 --> 00:09:56.727
Now, I want to know
where those rats come from.

00:09:56.751 --> 00:09:58.431
- SOLDIER: Wait here.

00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:00.922
- VICTOR: Send scouts.
If we can find a way to slow them...

00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:04.410
Stop them, or send them to hell,
it'll be worth the risk.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.850
- SOLDIER: Sire, she's here.

00:10:06.984 --> 00:10:09.803
- VICTOR: Good.
This is a war unlike any other.

00:10:09.644 --> 00:10:11.324
But it is still a war.

00:10:11.426 --> 00:10:13.990
Dismissed. And have faith.

00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:15.591
It's not over yet.

00:10:15.637 --> 00:10:17.317
- SOLDIERS: Yes, sir.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.353
- VICTOR: Come, I need you.

00:10:22.102 --> 00:10:23.702
- AMICIA: Very well.

00:10:23.607 --> 00:10:24.967 position:80% line:20%
- SOLDIER: Count.

00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:36.398
- VICTOR: So you survived those beasts?

00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:37.447
- AMICIA: Barely.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.880
I'm sorry... for your land.

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:43.504
- VICTOR: A Lord should know
that no peace lasts forever.

00:10:43.558 --> 00:10:49.748
But I confess that after years of war
I had dared to hope that this one would...

00:10:49.574 --> 00:10:51.254
- AMICIA: I understand.

00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:53.468
The scars are still so vivid.

00:10:53.508 --> 00:10:56.375
They fill the mind when you want only rest.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:57.625
Er... sorry... I...

00:10:57.479 --> 00:10:58.679
- VICTOR: No...

00:10:59.462 --> 00:11:00.462
That's...

00:11:00.547 --> 00:11:01.587
Exactly it...

00:11:01.512 --> 00:11:03.246
- AMICIA: It's only human...

00:11:04.112 --> 00:11:05.112
I think.

00:11:04.813 --> 00:11:06.493
- VICTOR: You're right.

00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:09.170
But it doesn't stop you from being there
when battle calls.

00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:10.325
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:11:18.236 --> 00:11:20.036
Is the child really coming?

00:11:19.942 --> 00:11:22.142
- VICTOR: All the signs are here.

00:11:22.155 --> 00:11:24.222
- AMICIA: You mean... the rats?

00:11:25.008 --> 00:11:27.408
- VICTOR: Not only the rats... Come.

00:11:27.442 --> 00:11:29.122
You'll see for yourself.

00:11:28.566 --> 00:11:29.686
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.255
- VICTOR: (DRAWS SWORD)

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.390
- VICTOR: Emilie wants the boy, Amicia.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.427
I'm sorry but she's sure now.

00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:02.068
- AMICIA: Sure about what?

00:12:02.093 --> 00:12:04.432
- VICTOR: That your brother
is the <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:12:04.446 --> 00:12:07.235
She must have him so you must die.

00:12:07.368 --> 00:12:09.048
- AMICIA: No no, listen!

00:12:09.084 --> 00:12:11.601
You're all completely wrong about this.

00:12:11.456 --> 00:12:13.259
Your cult... Everything.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.432
- VICTOR: You're probably right.

00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:17.473
Because I invented most of it.

00:12:18.034 --> 00:12:19.714
And I did it for her.

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:20.839
- AMICIA: What?

00:12:20.247 --> 00:12:21.767
- VICTOR: Emilie...

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.524
Her bloody parents broke her mind
until she tried to take her own life.

00:12:25.648 --> 00:12:27.766
Poisoned her own body.

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:32.164
So I brought her here,
offered her this <i>Child of Embers</i> story

00:12:31.904 --> 00:12:34.038
And not only did she believe it.

00:12:34.072 --> 00:12:36.672
She turned it into hope for the people.

00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:38.342
- AMICIA: You've fed her a lie.

00:12:37.968 --> 00:12:40.368
- VICTOR: What are you trying to do?

00:12:39.924 --> 00:12:41.551
Accept your fate!

00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:44.751
Urhh... Damn you!

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.278
- AMICIA: Hugo... Run!

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:53.083
- VICTOR: How dare you!

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:54.811
Come back!

00:12:55.105 --> 00:12:57.172
- AMICIA: Get back to them! Go!

00:12:56.997 --> 00:12:59.643
- VICTOR: I won't lose her!
Not for you!

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.110
- AMICIA: Go to hell!

00:13:00.323 --> 00:13:02.323
- VICTOR: Where are you going?

00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:03.274
- AMICIA: You won't have him!

00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:07.356
Move! To the right! Come on! Quick!

00:13:07.197 --> 00:13:10.300
- VICTOR: You can't imagine
what's at stake!

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.827
- AMICIA: Go to hell, you bastard!

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:18.795
- VICTOR: I tried to be patient...

00:13:18.977 --> 00:13:21.954
- AMICIA: No... No! You won't get him!

00:13:23.374 --> 00:13:27.784
- VICTOR: I'll find you!
And you will die like a dog!

00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:29.628
- SERVANT: Hey! What's going on?

00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:32.256
- AMICIA: I need help, please!
How do I get out of here?

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.350
- SERVANT: Who are you?

00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:36.073 line:20%
- VICTOR: Where is she?

00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:37.727 line:20%
- SERVANT: Er... behind that dresser.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.700
- AMICIA: No! Shut up!

00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:39.518 position:80% line:20%
- VICTOR: Right, everybody out!

00:13:39.412 --> 00:13:41.279
- AMICIA: Keep out of sight.

00:13:40.565 --> 00:13:42.565 line:20%
- VICTOR: You and me... Now...

00:13:44.872 --> 00:13:47.672
Come on. Let's finish this.

00:13:47.592 --> 00:13:52.248
I know it seems unfair.
But you don't know what it takes to rule.

00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:55.205
War. It's so easy.

00:13:55.276 --> 00:13:57.946
I could destroy everything.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.625
But she showed me another way.

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:04.309
She has a light about her.
You've seen it!

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.420
(DOOR OPENS)

00:14:15.606 --> 00:14:17.472
- MAN: Hey! What's going on?

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.998
- AMICIA: Stay back!

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:20.376
- MAN: No! You're trespassing!

00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:24.888
- VICTOR: Where are you running?

00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:26.035
There's no escape!

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:29.087
- AMICIA: Mother, Lucas...
If he touched them...

00:14:28.832 --> 00:14:32.156
- VICTOR: It's too late!
Now she knows he exists.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.842
- AMICIA: Bastard! Bastard!

00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:35.222
(POT BREAKS)

00:14:41.138 --> 00:14:42.138
(POT BREAKS)

00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:45.106
- VICTOR: People believe in her
as much as in the Child.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.510
- AMICIA: Stay away from me!

00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:51.941
- VICTOR: Don't you get it?
This is bigger than YOU! Give up!

00:14:52.168 --> 00:14:56.374
Surrender your brother!
We can do this the easy way!

00:14:56.405 --> 00:15:00.393
- AMICIA: You're crazy! You'll all die
if you take him away from us!

00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:02.313
- VICTOR: Don't be so dramatic!

00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:05.333
You'll simply disappear
and the world won't care.

00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:06.538
Just let go!

00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:10.996
- AMICIA: You've lived a lie for so long.
You can't see the truth anymore!

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.599
- VICTOR: The truth
is everything's rotten but her!

00:15:14.253 --> 00:15:17.652
She's the only reason
this world is not burning.

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:20.604
But we will protect your brother
from that rot.

00:15:20.725 --> 00:15:23.504
All right. Let's play.

00:15:23.948 --> 00:15:26.427
I'm good at this game, you'll see.

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:28.504
- AMICIA: GO TO HELL!!1

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.772
You pig!

00:15:31.592 --> 00:15:33.823
I need to find the others, quick!

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.223
Must be a way to get back upstairs.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:44.480
(GROANS) He ruined my shoulder for good.
(GROANS) It hurts...

00:15:50.633 --> 00:15:52.252
Too noisy...

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:55.178 line:20%
- VICTOR: Huh? You chose the hard way.

00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:57.112
- AMICIA: No time. Quick! Move!

00:15:56.678 --> 00:15:59.833
- VICTOR: I hear you.
Fear makes you sloppy.

00:16:07.672 --> 00:16:09.405
- AMICIA: Lose him! Quick!

00:16:15.634 --> 00:16:18.962
- VICTOR: Amicia, you can't hide from me
behind that.

00:16:22.692 --> 00:16:24.492
- AMICIA: No way out. Hide!

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.497
Through here, quiet.
The door, gotta lock him inside!

00:16:39.267 --> 00:16:41.166
Don't stop. You can do it!

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.159
- VICTOR: What? You dirty little... NO!

00:16:55.634 --> 00:16:58.273
- AMICIA: Faster! Come on come on!

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.860
- VICTOR: Wherever you go, I'll find y...
Grhhhh... (ANIMAL NOISE)

00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:03.647
- AMICIA: Yes... Go go!

00:17:08.914 --> 00:17:11.814
Now where's the exit?
Give me a goddamn exit!

00:17:11.347 --> 00:17:14.000
- VICTOR: Running again?
You're tireless.

00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:16.534
- AMICIA: Shut... the hell... up!

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:20.520 position:20% line:20%
- VICTOR: (MANIAC LAUGHTER)
You did it! Amazing!

00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:24.388 position:20% line:20%
You know...
you remind me of old times.

00:17:24.282 --> 00:17:26.012
Of myself...

00:17:26.205 --> 00:17:30.706
Now, I'll see you...
\where you blood flows!

00:17:29.986 --> 00:17:33.832
- AMICIA: Please! Stop this madness...

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.763
I can't...

00:17:40.949 --> 00:17:46.268
Don't faint now... Hugo...
They'll take him away...

00:17:47.346 --> 00:17:50.919
Mother... Lucas...
Get them out of here...

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.333
(GROANS) Even if it hurts...

00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:03.540
Pain... it's all you have...

00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:06.453
You know it well...
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:09.888
So use it... Use it against them!

00:18:16.574 --> 00:18:18.307
- EMILIE: Don't be afraid.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.520
Yes, you failed, but...

00:18:21.522 --> 00:18:23.722
This child was never truly yours.

00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:26.414
I feel so full of him.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.722
- BÉATRICE: Hugo won't fill
the wound of your past.

00:18:30.724 --> 00:18:33.169
He will fill no void in you.

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:35.466
You'll die.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.980
Everybody will.

00:18:36.578 --> 00:18:37.618
- EMILIE: No.

00:18:38.363 --> 00:18:39.723
He will be loved.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:41.489
He will shine.

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:43.409
Like a brighter sun.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:46.407
Propel this darkness. And I...

00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:49.298
I'll just be a mother.

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:52.009
Watching the first steps of a God.

00:18:51.938 --> 00:18:53.378
- AMICIA: Shut up!

00:18:53.594 --> 00:18:55.794
You have no claim to this family!

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:57.254
- BÉATRICE: Amicia!

00:18:58.306 --> 00:19:00.573
- EMILIE: How are you still alive?

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.260
- AMICIA: Where's Hugo?

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.385
- LUCAS: Inside, go! Run!

00:19:08.925 --> 00:19:10.578
- BÉATRICE: Amicia, NO!

00:19:10.715 --> 00:19:12.155
- EMILIE: At last.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.756
- VICTOR: Sorry, my love.
But this one's a hell of a fighter.

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:22.107
- VICTOR: Now this...

00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:29.774
(SWORD CLANGING
ON THE GROUND)

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:38.019
This is an invitation I can't refuse.

00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:42.690
You caught me by surprise, I'm impressed.

00:19:43.424 --> 00:19:46.942
You're quite something, you know.
You face me...

00:19:47.056 --> 00:19:52.336
Thinking with all your soul
that you can defeat me.

00:19:51.863 --> 00:19:54.763
- AMICIA: I can...
You won't have my brother.

00:19:54.683 --> 00:19:57.150
- VICTOR: (SCOFFS)
Such a dedication.

00:20:00.252 --> 00:20:03.091
- BÉATRICE: NO! My daughter!

00:20:04.857 --> 00:20:07.757
- VICTOR: You have a burning fire inside you.

00:20:09.627 --> 00:20:11.992
But a flame without discipline...

00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:14.652
Doesn't make a soldier.

00:20:15.136 --> 00:20:17.396
It consumes them from within.

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:19.775
- AMICIA: I'm not a soldier!

00:20:19.447 --> 00:20:21.127
- VICTOR: Oh, I know...

00:20:21.196 --> 00:20:23.996
You fight because you don't have a choice.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:28.198
I chose this life.
This is why you're fail.

00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:30.468
- AMICIA: You talk a lot. Coward!

00:20:32.187 --> 00:20:34.120
- VICTOR: Steady your stance!

00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:36.114
Stand your ground!

00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:42.520
Grip that sword properly.
You're a disgrace to it!

00:20:46.293 --> 00:20:48.759
You never fight to defend yourself...

00:20:48.525 --> 00:20:50.664
Fight to kill, to conquer.

00:20:50.704 --> 00:20:53.571
- AMICIA: Whatever...
You're still a coward!

00:20:54.759 --> 00:20:56.039
- LUCAS: Amicia!

00:20:57.537 --> 00:21:00.545

to define me?

00:21:01.015 --> 00:21:02.295
- AMICIA: I'M...

00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:03.005
AMICIA...

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.050
DE RUNE!

00:21:04.552 --> 00:21:06.352

00:21:05.954 --> 00:21:08.154
- AMICIA: AND I KNEEL TO NO ONE!!

00:21:08.219 --> 00:21:09.659

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.423
- BÉATRICE: No no no... Amicia!
