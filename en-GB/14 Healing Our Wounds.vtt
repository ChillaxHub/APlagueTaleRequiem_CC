00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:53.182
- LUCAS: I thought I'd never get back.

00:00:53.394 --> 00:00:55.261
- AMICIA: Not all of us did.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.005
But he'll get better now.

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:04.072
We all will.

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:14.711
- LUCAS: Come talk if you want.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.149

Fresh air...

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.505
(WOOD CREAKING)

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.616
(WAVES CRASHING)

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:31.784
The Rascasse...

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:33.603
You saved our lives.

00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:45.396
(EXHALES) I could sleep for weeks.

00:01:45.764 --> 00:01:47.204
I need a bath too.

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:50.497
Hey.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:51.604
- LUCAS: Oh, hey.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.625
How do you feel?

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.246
- AMICIA: You first.

00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:58.186
- LUCAS: Just like...

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:00.362
After a strange dream.

00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:01.744
A terrible one.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:05.638
But I couldn't wake up until I dreamt it.

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:06.886
- AMICIA: Changed.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.520
- LUCAS: Reborn.

- AMICIA: There's a home we head now, Lucas.

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.165
Would you come with us?

00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:15.556
- LUCAS: Well... I think...

00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:18.590
You and Hugo are my home, so...

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:20.929
Yes.

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:23.425
- AMICIA: We're glad to have you with us.

00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:41.818
Passed out.

00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:44.011
Stay there.

00:02:44.703 --> 00:02:48.301
You don't wanna wake up after this.
Trust me.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.750
How's the view?

00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:54.183
- HUGO: It's... nice.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.766
- AMICIA: What's on your mind?

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:57.791
- HUGO: Do you think I'm different?

00:02:57.442 --> 00:02:59.843
- AMICIA: Well... I don't know.

00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:02.244
Are you hungry?

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.980
- HUGO: Huh?

00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:04.594

- HUGO: (CHUCKLES)

00:03:09.582 --> 00:03:12.169
I... feel... different.

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.394
Things...

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.200
...feel different.

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:19.894
- AMICIA: It's called <i>growing up</i>, Hugo.

00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:23.296
Some things just make it go faster.

00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:24.344
- HUGO: Yes?

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:25.575
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:28.663
But... we'll slow things down from now on.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.907
We'll take all the time we need.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:34.319
- HUGO: I can't wait to be in the mountain.

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:35.248
- AMICIA: Soon.

00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:36.476
Very soon.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.063
We're going home, Hugo.

00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:40.812
Our home.

00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:41.844
- HUGO: Yes.

00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:06.664
- AMICIA: I hope La Cuna
is under the water now.

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:09.077
(WHISPERS) Get it out of your mind.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.569
It's over.

00:04:14.634 --> 00:04:15.634
Hey.

00:04:16.462 --> 00:04:18.142
- SOPHIA: Slept well?

00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:21.503
- AMICIA: I woke up thinking I was dead.

00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:23.565
- SOPHIA: I know that one.

00:04:24.692 --> 00:04:26.372
What will you do now?

00:04:28.254 --> 00:04:29.825
- AMICIA: My Mother...

00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:32.929
She had a house...
An old house in the mountain.

00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:36.854
I promised him a chance to be happy.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.022
That's where we'll get it.

00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.081
- SOPHIA: Sounds nice.

00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:44.892
- AMICIA: You'll always be welcome there.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.380
I know you don't like heights.

00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:48.479
- SOPHIA: Hey... People change.

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.826

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.630
- HUGO: Is he... fine?

00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:11.903
- AMICIA: Who knows...
How about we ask him directly?

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:12.929
- HUGO: Alright.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.259
Are you alive?

00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:19.561
- ARNAUD: What do you think?

00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:21.937
- HUGO: Dead people don't talk.

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.191
- ARNAUD: (CHUCKLES)

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:24.756
Good catch.

Hey...

00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:31.195
I'm sorry for...

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.083
Well...

00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:35.814
Everything.

00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:40.691
Thank you for getting your sister to help me.

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:42.578
You saved me.

00:05:43.588 --> 00:05:46.532
- AMICIA: Look who finally decided to be nice.

00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:49.519
- ARNAUD: Don't make me regret it.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.429
- AMICIA: The war's over, Arnaud.

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:53.917
We've all earned the rest.

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:55.865
You should try it too.

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.509
- ARNAUD: (CHUCKLES)

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.520

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

00:06:05.475 --> 00:06:07.209
- LUCAS: It's coming fast.

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:10.198
- ARNAUD: You see?
That's the thing with war.

00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.064
You don't get to decide
when it's over.

00:06:19.022 --> 00:06:21.922
- AMICIA: No no no...
This <i>can't</i> be happening!

We'll get that sail down.

Man the rope on the other side.

00:06:27.338 --> 00:06:29.018

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:32.609 position:20%

Stay inside the cabin at all costs, alright?

If they board us... Done.

- SOPHIA: Good.

00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:47.188

in the distance.

- AMICIA: No no no! What now?

00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:52.320
- SOPHIA: Turn the sail to the wind!
We need a better angle.

00:06:51.116 --> 00:06:54.032
- ARNAUD: I'll give you some slack
while you pull it toward you.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.948
- AMICIA: Yes. We have no right
to fail this, Arnaud!

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.219
- ARNAUD: We won't!

00:07:00.784 --> 00:07:03.728
- SOPHIA: It's working!
We're picking up speed.

00:07:03.562 --> 00:07:05.720
- ARNAUD: But it won't be enough.
They're coming!

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:05.831
- SOPHIA: We're too heavy!

00:07:06.023 --> 00:07:07.823
Throw some cargo overboard.

00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:09.305
- ARNAUD: On it. Ha!

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.041

They're going to ram us!

- SOPHIA: Oh no!

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:56.970
- ARNAUD: Amicia! AMICIA!

00:07:57.082 --> 00:07:58.362
What's going on?

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:00.149
Oh no...

00:08:00.808 --> 00:08:04.221
They fell overboard.
Get up, Amicia!

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.187
- AMICIA: LUCAS?? SOPHIA??

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:19.602
No!

- ARNAUD: Come on!
I'll cut you all to pieces!

- ARNAUD: Come here, Victor!
Don't be a coward!

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.048
- VICTOR: You're mistaking strategy
for cowardice. But I'm not surprised.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.490
- ARNAUD: Don't worry.
You're next!

00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:47.699

until this bastard's dead.

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:52.930
- VICTOR: And save your breath, old man!

00:08:56.533 --> 00:09:01.231
- ARNAUD: Come on! Come!
I'll dance on your corpses!

- ARNAUD: You'll never get the boy.
You hear me?

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:12.267
- VICTOR: Take them!

00:09:12.712 --> 00:09:16.187
This is where our war for tomorrow begins.

00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:19.504
- AMICIA: There will be no tomorrow.
For anyone!

00:09:20.454 --> 00:09:21.621
- HUGO: Come hide!

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:24.788
- AMICIA: No... we... we can do this!

00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:32.878
- ARNAUD: I'm getting warmer.
You will die quicker!

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.333
- VICTOR: You don't deserve the child!

00:09:35.198 --> 00:09:36.878
- HUGO: Come, Amicia!

00:09:36.516 --> 00:09:38.196
- AMICIA: Stay inside!

00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:39.186

00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:41.147
- HUGO: No!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.632
Amicia, NO!

00:09:44.554 --> 00:09:45.554
Amicia!

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:50.179
Amicia...

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:53.808
You killed her...

00:09:54.782 --> 00:09:56.716
- ARNAUD: Hugo, come with me!

00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:05.118
Hugo, come here!

00:10:08.549 --> 00:10:11.877
- VICTOR: Sorry, child.
The rats can't help you here.

00:10:12.253 --> 00:10:13.613
- HUGO: (YELLING)

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:23.274

00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:25.417
- ARNAUD: Alright!
You've won!

00:10:26.182 --> 00:10:27.382
Don't hurt him!

00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:30.195
- VICTOR: Hurt him?

00:10:31.782 --> 00:10:33.222
He's Emilie's son.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.045
<i>My</i> son.

00:10:37.057 --> 00:10:38.353
He's a God.

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:41.129
He's our doom, Victor.

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:43.599
You need to let him go.

00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:44.832
To his sister.

00:10:45.373 --> 00:10:46.413
- VICTOR: No.

00:10:47.687 --> 00:10:49.367
I owe this to Emilie.

00:10:50.077 --> 00:10:53.635
With her, I tried so hard
to believe this world.

00:10:53.827 --> 00:10:57.128
Wasn't just blood... and war...

00:10:57.634 --> 00:11:00.999
But I can throw a blanket
over these flames.

00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:04.324
But the truth is...

00:11:05.913 --> 00:11:07.273
People like us...

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:09.763
We are born to feed that fire.

00:11:11.762 --> 00:11:15.111
- ARNAUD: Whatever you're planning with him...
It won't work.

00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:16.494
He will destroy you.

00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:19.062
- VICTOR: He'll destroy what I tell him to.

00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:27.561
We'll set this world aflame.

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:31.179
And I'll forge an empire from that fire.

00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:33.066
A more righteous one.

00:11:33.913 --> 00:11:37.611
- ARNAUD: It's not over, you coward!
You owe me blood!

00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:40.632
- VICTOR: I paid that price already.

00:11:40.543 --> 00:11:44.132
Now <i>my son</i> need to rest.

00:11:44.342 --> 00:11:45.342
Finish this!

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.079
