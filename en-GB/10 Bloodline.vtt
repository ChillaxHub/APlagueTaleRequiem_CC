WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:42.778
X - BLOODLINE

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.106
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:55.997
Like nothing happened.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.490
- SOPHIA: We're good.

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:04.420
Especially you.
You're the sneakiest child I've ever met.

00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:10.790
- AMICIA: Look... If there's
no fort in your dream...

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.500
Then we'll look
for the round tower, alright?

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.653
- HUGO: Alright.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.222
- AMICIA: And maybe...
They decorated the island even more.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.846
- SOPHIA: So... that was...

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:45.286
I don't even know what that was.

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:46.360
- AMICIA: Me neither.

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.721
But we have a lead.

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:49.586
- SOPHIA: Pragmatic, I like that.

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:52.905
Why not check that map again.
Unless you know where that tower is.

00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:54.316
- AMICIA: Hm... why not.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:56.445
That was quite something.

00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:59.640
But I still can't believe
you went to a convern.

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:02.045
- SOPHIA: My mother
came from a wealthy family.

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:05.117
They weren't exactly pleased
when they found out my father was a smuggler.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.817
So after a convern I went to...

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.748
...cleanse me of his sins.

00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:12.131
- AMICIA: It wasn't
very effective, it seems.

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:14.126
- SOPHIA: I'd rather be
a sinner and be free.

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:17.040
So I escaped, and joined my father and...

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.834
- HUGO: We must be careful.

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.546
If my dream was wrong...

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.982
More things can be wrong.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:25.671
- SOPHIA: Hey, look around you. It's fine.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.314
We're centuries later, right?

00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:29.437
- AMICIA: She's right. We're with you.

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:37.342
Let's take another look at that map.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.530
Careful with the drop here.

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:42.302
- HUGO: Yes.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:49.125
- AMICIA: Alright, so...
Any tower here... or...

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.415
- SOPHIA: No... But...
That symbol could be our chapel?

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.650
That capella where they took her.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.523
- AMICIA: You're right.

00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:58.373
- HUGO: It looks like it's burning.

00:03:57.818 --> 00:03:59.498
- SOPHIA: It's a drawing.

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:02.431
So... knowing the sanctuary's there...

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.031
I think it's in the way to that big decorated tree.
Probably past the windmills.

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:09.041
- AMICIA: We're back on track then. Let's go.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.840
- HUGO: Alright.

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:16.861
- SOPHIA: Maybe we'll see
some fire jumping and other...

00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:20.952
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)
We'll take a look anyway.

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:01.564
- AMICIA: That's our tower over there, right?

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.263
- SOPHIA: Well... A piece of it, at least.

00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:05.292
- HUGO: Everything is so old here.

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:07.616
How can there be anything that helps.

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:09.451
- AMICIA: There will be.

00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:10.959
The past never dies, Hugo.

00:06:11.712 --> 00:06:14.362
Vision of it travelled
through your dream, didn't they?

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.134
- SOPHIA: And that sanctuary
still has a lot to tell.

00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:18.001
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:21.011
- AMICIA: We'll find something in that chapel.

00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:36.271
Almost there.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:37.879
- SOPHIA: Hugo, wait.

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:40.333
Would my knight conquer that tower for me?

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.019
- HUGO: What?

00:06:40.693 --> 00:06:42.646
- SOPHIA: I wanna see how you charge it.

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:43.945
Claim it for me. Go!

00:06:44.193 --> 00:06:45.193
- HUGO: Yes!

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:46.746
- AMICIA: Stay in sight!

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:47.479
- HUGO: Yes!

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:48.934
- AMICIA: Thanks.

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:50.508
It's a bit hard for him.

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:51.265
- SOPHIA: I...

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.260
I wanted to ask you...

00:06:53.628 --> 00:06:55.495
Are you sure about all this?

00:06:55.326 --> 00:06:57.793
It seems like a heavy burden for him.

00:06:57.247 --> 00:06:58.607
- AMICIA: I know.

00:06:58.755 --> 00:06:59.755
And it is.

00:07:00.422 --> 00:07:02.072
That's why we're doing this.

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:05.892
- SOPHIA: Listen... we may not know
each other well... But...

00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:09.260
You're chasing ghosts.
Ghosts that scare him.

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:11.886
- AMICIA: We've gone through hell, Sophia.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.000
You can't imagine...

00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:14.126
- SOPHIA: I can't.

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:16.311
But the question is: <i>"Does he need more?"</i>

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:18.108
- AMICIA: We have nothing else.

00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:19.214
- SOPHIA: I believe you.

00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:20.457
Fine.

00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:01.719
- SOPHIA: It surely
doesn't sound as... appealing.

00:10:02.942 --> 00:10:06.592
- AMICIA: I don't think the Count and Countess
... the Order's writings.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.219
They must've considered
the plague too scared.

00:10:08.902 --> 00:10:11.802
- SOPHIA: There is only one way to find out.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.236
- AMICIA: Yes... Let's move.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.260
What's going on?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.960
- SOPHIA: There's a storm coming.

00:11:23.858 --> 00:11:25.658
- AMICIA: How can you tell?

00:11:26.123 --> 00:11:27.643
- SOPHIA: Trust me.

00:11:30.836 --> 00:11:31.836
He's sad.

00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:35.008
All this because of a dream.

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:39.676
- AMICIA: When's the last time
a dream meant everything to you?

00:11:40.947 --> 00:11:43.547
- SOPHIA: The day I stop being a child.

00:11:49.696 --> 00:11:50.696
Hey.

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:52.742
That's a pretty flower.

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:55.013
- HUGO: You want it?

00:11:54.349 --> 00:11:55.949
- SOPHIA: Of course.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.620
- AMICIA: Hmm... There was a time
when I was the one getting the flower.

00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.487
- SOPHIA: Time passes, sweetheart.

00:12:03.344 --> 00:12:04.384
They grow up.

00:12:08.368 --> 00:12:11.750
- AMICIA: Alright.
Let's get to this fort quickly.

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:15.434
- HUGO: We could stay here.

00:12:16.017 --> 00:12:17.217
I like it here.

00:12:18.328 --> 00:12:21.228
- AMICIA: Staying here won't help you, Hugo.

00:12:21.312 --> 00:12:22.352
We must move.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.740
Plus... there's a storm coming.

00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:34.273
- SOPHIA: So... Hugo.

00:12:34.109 --> 00:12:36.776
You ever offered a flower
to a lady your age?

00:12:36.601 --> 00:12:37.601
- HUGO: No.

00:12:37.681 --> 00:12:39.236
I prefer feathers now.

00:12:39.109 --> 00:12:42.053
- SOPHIA: Ah...
Moving onto something exciting.

00:12:41.904 --> 00:12:43.872
Flowers, feathers...

00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:45.554
- HUGO: Feathers are better.

00:12:45.047 --> 00:12:46.167
- SOPHIA: Why?

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.015
- HUGO: Because they make you fly.

00:12:47.675 --> 00:12:48.834
- SOPHIA: I get it.

00:12:48.342 --> 00:12:50.796
- AMICIA: Well don't fly away
right now please.

00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:07.260
- SOPHIA: Hmm... Small problem here.

00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:08.879
- HUGO: How are we going to cross?

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:10.692
- AMICIA: Let's see down there.

00:13:15.801 --> 00:13:17.601
- HUGO: Don't get so close.

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:19.350
- SOPHIA: That bridge
looks about to collapse.

00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:21.162
- AMICIA: Let's see if we can finish it.

00:13:23.397 --> 00:13:25.330
Hm... Maybe with my crossbow?

00:13:30.681 --> 00:13:31.681
Yes.

00:13:31.506 --> 00:13:33.373
- HUGO: Is it going to work?

00:13:32.936 --> 00:13:34.536
- AMICIA: Hopefully.

00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:39.862
Well, it works.

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:58.783
- SOPHIA: Wow... Look at that view.

00:13:58.895 --> 00:14:00.495
- AMICIA: Beautiful.

00:14:00.396 --> 00:14:02.463
You're missing the sea already?

00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:04.606
- SOPHIA: Not yet. But it will come back.

00:14:04.382 --> 00:14:07.282
- HUGO: But... you're not leaving now, right?

00:14:07.334 --> 00:14:10.080
- SOPHIA: Not until I've repaid
my debt to your sister.

00:14:09.747 --> 00:14:10.787
- HUGO: What?

00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:11.953
- SOPHIA: She didn't tell you?

00:14:11.694 --> 00:14:13.134
She saved my life.

00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:14.885
- AMICIA: Oh... Well...

00:14:14.427 --> 00:14:16.107
- HUGO: I'm glad she did.

00:14:15.824 --> 00:14:17.504
- SOPHIA: Well, me too.

00:25:27.784 --> 00:25:29.304
- PRISONER: (SPITS)

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:33.286
- MAN: It's alright.

00:25:33.319 --> 00:25:35.360
It will be over soon.

00:25:36.971 --> 00:25:38.764
- GUARD: To hell with this shit.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.629
You've got a problem, Diaz?

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.900
Well...

00:25:46.095 --> 00:25:47.615
Our slaves escaped.

00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:49.351
And now what?

00:25:49.996 --> 00:25:52.940
(HIS ACCENT IS TOO STRONG THAT I HEAR NOTHING)

00:25:53.107 --> 00:25:54.227
- DIAZ: Wrong!

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:56.320
We're not working for her anymore.

00:25:57.326 --> 00:25:59.460
It's all in a fresco...

00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:02.401
The rats announce the coming of the child.

00:26:05.217 --> 00:26:06.417
So it's simple.

00:26:06.629 --> 00:26:08.931
We please them, we please the child.

00:26:08.658 --> 00:26:11.524
We buy ourselves a seat next to his throne.

00:26:14.304 --> 00:26:15.984
...will bow before us.

00:26:16.861 --> 00:26:18.735
And the world will follow.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.640
- GUARD: So tell me...

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.222
How many of us will feed the rats
before we see your child?

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:31.999
- DIAZ: You have so little faith.

00:26:45.282 --> 00:26:46.503
Anyone else?

00:26:50.535 --> 00:26:51.535
Fine.

00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:56.373
The blood will show the child
the way of the chapel.

00:27:04.135 --> 00:27:06.535
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Goddamn maniacs.

00:27:09.372 --> 00:27:11.305
- HUGO: We have to help them!

00:27:16.489 --> 00:27:18.622
- AMICIA: It's already too late.

00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:20.879
- HUGO: I'll stop them!

00:27:28.964 --> 00:27:30.964
- HUGO: I wanted to save them!

00:27:31.012 --> 00:27:32.212
- AMICIA: Hugo!

00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:34.368
You don't kill people just like that!

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.000
- HUGO: Why? You do it all the time!

00:27:35.508 --> 00:27:37.108
- AMICIA: Because...

00:27:36.143 --> 00:27:38.809
- HUGO: And I can kill quicker than you!

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.144
- AMICIA: You don't attack people by yourself!

00:27:41.069 --> 00:27:43.403
You listen to me and do as I say.

00:27:43.032 --> 00:27:44.152
Is that clear?

00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:47.057
- HUGO: I don't care!
They're all dead now anyway.

00:27:47.631 --> 00:27:48.831
- AMICIA: Hugo!

00:27:48.103 --> 00:27:50.390
- SOPHIA: What... the... hell?

00:27:54.165 --> 00:27:56.244
- AMICIA: Hugo, listen!

00:28:18.089 --> 00:28:19.089
Hugo!

00:28:19.025 --> 00:28:20.874
- SOPHIA: What was that?

00:28:21.003 --> 00:28:24.431
This is madness!
You never said...

00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:25.112
- AMICIA: What?

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:29.795
<i>"Oh, by the way, my brother controls rats
and gets them to eat people"</i>?

00:28:30.964 --> 00:28:32.487
You'd run away.

00:28:32.736 --> 00:28:33.736
And I...

00:28:33.858 --> 00:28:35.538
I didn't want you to.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.274
It was wrong, yes.

00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:42.705
But I thought this place
would give us a chance.

00:28:42.803 --> 00:28:45.788
I thought... you wouldn't have to see us...

00:28:46.131 --> 00:28:47.275
...like this.

00:28:47.307 --> 00:28:50.039
- SOPHIA: Just... go talk to him.

00:42:16.335 --> 00:42:17.935
- SOPHIA: Hey, here!

00:57:50.647 --> 00:57:52.327
- HUGO: No... I knew it.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.851
- AMICIA: Sarcrificed... like animals.

00:57:58.772 --> 00:57:59.772
- HUGO: Why?

00:58:06.673 --> 00:58:09.513
- SOPHIA: Look on the door...
Your Order's symbol.

00:58:09.228 --> 00:58:12.300
- AMICIA: Let's get inside
that chapel and leave.

00:58:25.983 --> 00:58:28.803
- SOPHIA: There're pretty recent.
Who did this?

00:58:28.915 --> 00:58:29.915
Milo?

00:58:29.676 --> 00:58:31.356
- AMICIA: This fresco...

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.853
It's the Carrier and his Protector.

00:58:34.648 --> 00:58:37.048
It's the only one where she appears.

00:58:36.553 --> 00:58:39.878
- SOPHIA: So... what?
This chapel was dedicated to her?

00:58:39.577 --> 00:58:41.269
- AMICIA: To the Protector.

00:58:41.364 --> 00:58:43.764
Aelia was just filling the position.

00:58:44.057 --> 00:58:45.057
That was...

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:46.780
...her function...

00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:48.829
...among the Order.

00:58:48.277 --> 00:58:50.544
- HUGO: They wanted to punish her.

00:58:59.648 --> 00:59:01.781
- AMICIA: Let's look down there.

00:59:00.728 --> 00:59:02.928
- SOPHIA: Where the hell is Milo?

00:59:02.426 --> 00:59:04.106
- AMICIA: I don't know.

00:59:03.924 --> 00:59:05.604
Aelia's more important.

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:08.170
A crypt.

00:59:08.027 --> 00:59:09.328
- HUGO: There's nothing.

00:59:09.122 --> 00:59:10.802
- AMICIA: Let me look.

00:59:37.925 --> 00:59:39.210
<i>"Unum...</i>

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:41.892
<i>"Twueri...</i>

00:59:42.242 --> 00:59:44.068
<i>"Omnes...</i>

00:59:44.656 --> 00:59:46.227
<i>Tuendo..."</i>

00:59:48.039 --> 00:59:50.753
- SOPHIA: <i>"Protect one, protect all."</i>

00:59:52.605 --> 00:59:55.005
- AMICIA: That's from the Protector.

00:59:55.075 --> 00:59:57.009
The Order locked her in here.

01:00:06.722 --> 01:00:08.402
- HUGO: Be careful...

01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:10.319
There might be a spider in there.

01:00:16.516 --> 01:00:18.316
- SOPHIA: This thing again!

01:00:18.057 --> 01:00:19.057
Why?

01:00:25.938 --> 01:00:27.618
- AMICIA: She's angry...

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.600
Scared for the Carrier.

01:00:31.978 --> 01:00:33.178
She's so young.

01:00:34.299 --> 01:00:35.981
She wants him back.

01:00:38.405 --> 01:00:40.405
She knows where they took him.

01:00:42.526 --> 01:00:43.646
The sanctuary.

01:00:45.015 --> 01:00:46.015
The palace.

01:00:47.397 --> 01:00:48.397
The fort.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:53.182
It's a map.

01:00:56.225 --> 01:00:58.091
This is where they took him.

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:01.587
- SOPHIA: Wait. So it's that easy?

01:01:02.572 --> 01:01:04.572
Under the map. Just like that?

01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:06.762
- AMICIA: Just...

01:01:07.132 --> 01:01:08.172
...like that.

01:01:09.926 --> 01:01:11.606
A Protector's legacy...

01:01:11.862 --> 01:01:13.542
...to another Protector.

01:01:14.777 --> 01:01:16.137
- SOPHIA: Sure...

01:01:16.412 --> 01:01:17.772
That makes sense.

01:01:19.232 --> 01:01:20.232
Whatever.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.280
Just another day in your life.

01:01:22.184 --> 01:01:24.518
- AMICIA: Let's go back to the map.

01:01:37.423 --> 01:01:40.057
- SOPHIA: It still doesn't tell us
where Milo is.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:43.676
- AMICIA: Well... It looks like
his work was done anyway.

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:03.102
- MILO: (YELLING) What the hell
are you doing in there?

01:02:03.162 --> 01:02:04.842
This place is sacred!

01:02:04.606 --> 01:02:05.606
- HUGO: No!

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.500
- MILO: You...

01:02:14.434 --> 01:02:16.167
It's you... You ()%(%()%(%

01:02:17.722 --> 01:02:19.402
Did you like my offering?

01:02:20.668 --> 01:02:22.108
I can help you ...

01:02:22.398 --> 01:02:24.699
I've got men, slaves.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.847
- HUGO: You killed all of them.

01:02:28.131 --> 01:02:29.411
- MILO: For you.

01:02:29.964 --> 01:02:33.036
The Countess,
she calls herself the Mother but...

01:02:32.837 --> 01:02:34.357
You need no Mother.

01:02:35.179 --> 01:02:36.619
You need servants.

01:02:36.958 --> 01:02:39.358
- HUGO: Stop telling me what I want!

01:02:56.051 --> 01:02:59.059
- MILO: You're... the girl...
from the painting?

01:02:59.349 --> 01:03:00.789
- SOPHIA: (SCOFFS)

01:03:00.889 --> 01:03:01.889
No.

01:03:06.164 --> 01:03:07.164
She is.

01:03:15.426 --> 01:03:16.946
Don't say anything.

01:03:26.616 --> 01:03:28.749
- GUARD: They killed Milo, here!

01:03:28.444 --> 01:03:29.920
- SOPHIA: Here we go. They're coming.

01:03:29.682 --> 01:03:31.816
- AMICIA: Hide. Watch over Hugo.

01:04:50.673 --> 01:04:52.784
- HUGO: Yes! Show them!

01:04:55.911 --> 01:04:57.736
Let me kill them too!

01:04:57.641 --> 01:04:59.321
- SOPHIA: Hugo, let her!

01:04:59.173 --> 01:05:01.880
- AMICIA: He won't hold.
I need to end this quickly.

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.956
- HUGO: There're too many. Let me help!

01:05:03.674 --> 01:05:06.785
- AMICIA: No! Close your eyes and *(^)(^(*.
You hear me?

01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:08.833
- HUGO: It's a (*^)^_)&amp;)*), Amicia!

01:05:09.024 --> 01:05:10.544
Let me )(#^%#@^^&amp;*.

01:05:10.802 --> 01:05:13.269
- SOPHIA: Listen to me now!
Stop this!

01:05:12.956 --> 01:05:15.156
- HUGO: Don't tell me what to do!

01:05:14.966 --> 01:05:16.791
(INAUDIBLE)

01:05:16.887 --> 01:05:19.087
- AMICIA: Hugo! Listen to Sophia!

01:05:29.904 --> 01:05:31.348
- SOPHIA: Hugo!

01:05:32.382 --> 01:05:34.062
- AMICIA: No! Go back!

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.620
- HUGO: No!

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:49.769
- AMICIA: Hugo, that's enough!

01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:50.960
- HUGO: They must die!

01:05:49.532 --> 01:05:50.732
- AMICIA: Stop!

01:05:51.007 --> 01:05:52.687
- AMICIA: They are dead!

01:05:52.341 --> 01:05:54.357
Everything's collapsing, we must leave!

01:05:54.253 --> 01:05:56.453
- SOPHIA: Amicia... Through here.

01:06:00.583 --> 01:06:02.023
To the sea, quick!

01:06:25.971 --> 01:06:27.091
- AMICIA: Hey!

01:06:26.701 --> 01:06:29.233
- HUGO: This place was supposed to help.

01:06:29.361 --> 01:06:31.041
And I'm still the same.

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.530
It's even worse!

01:06:41.432 --> 01:06:42.632
- SOPHIA: Hugo.

01:06:42.973 --> 01:06:43.973
Look at me!

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:47.862
Hugo, look at me!

01:06:47.423 --> 01:06:48.943
- AMICIA: Sophia...

01:06:50.575 --> 01:06:52.095
Why are you crying?

01:06:53.144 --> 01:06:55.677
- HUGO: Because you're going to leave.

01:06:55.573 --> 01:06:56.853
Because of me...

01:07:01.562 --> 01:07:03.162
- SOPHIA: Calm down.

01:07:03.548 --> 01:07:05.228
Now you listen to me.

01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:08.491
I've never seen anything like you two.

01:07:10.288 --> 01:07:12.955
And for some stupid reasons, I like you.

01:07:13.886 --> 01:07:17.534
And I like you at the shittiest worst
of your life, right?

01:07:18.403 --> 01:07:19.923
I'm fine with that.

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:24.082
Even the strangest things
happen for a reason.

01:07:23.892 --> 01:07:26.385
Sailor's stories are full of it.

01:07:26.893 --> 01:07:27.893
That said...

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:32.969
You need to <i>seriously</i> calm down
and <i>listen</i> to what adults tell you.

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:35.533
Deal?

01:07:38.831 --> 01:07:42.069
And <i>you</i> are <i>not</i> a goddamn army.

01:07:43.696 --> 01:07:45.216
He looks up to you.

01:07:45.426 --> 01:07:47.626
... your desparate becomes his.

01:07:47.966 --> 01:07:49.646
This is what happens.

01:07:49.426 --> 01:07:51.559
And <i>this</i> will have consequences.

01:08:05.466 --> 01:08:06.666
- AMICIA: So...

01:08:08.509 --> 01:08:10.109
Are-are you staying?

01:08:11.535 --> 01:08:13.668
- SOPHIA: Don't say it out loud.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:17.906
- HUGO: Thank you.

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:21.662
- SOPHIA: You should be the one's rowing.
