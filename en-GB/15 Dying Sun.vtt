WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:37.684
XV - DYING SUN

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:42.571
- AMICIA: (GROANS)

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:45.956
GODDAMN YOU,
YOU GODDAMN PIG!!

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:46.936
- ARNAUD: Shhh...

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:48.444
Stop shouting.

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:53.637
For the pain.

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:56.137
We use it on the battlefield.

00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:01.872
- AMICIA: Hugo?

00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:05.112
- ARNAUD: I'm...

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.660
I'm sorry...

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:09.019
I was stuck.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:12.953
I had to pull us out
or we'd be dead.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.626
- AMICIA: I need to take him back!

00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:18.305
The Count knows
what Hugo can do.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.179
We need to reach them before he...

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:24.097
He hurts him even more.

00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:26.264
- ARNAUD: Let's go.

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:29.493
Sophia and Lucas have gone ahead...
Looking for horses.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.833
Clench your teeth.

00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:35.608
- AMICIA: (GROANS) Goddammit!

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:37.016
- ARNAUD: Yeah...

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:42.867
- AMICIA: (GROANS)

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:45.315
- ARNAUD: Hold on.
I'll kick in soon.

00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.191
- AMICIA: The Count.

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:49.732
Did he say something?

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:51.172
- ARNAUD: You broke his heart.

00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:52.582
So now he wants war.

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:55.264
He said he'll use your brother...

00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:56.271
...to conquer.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.366
- AMICIA: There'll be nothing left to conquer.

00:01:58.255 --> 00:01:59.615
- ARNAUD: I know.

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.823
- AMICIA: Sophia and Lucas?

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.293
- ARNAUD: Shaken, but fine.

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.133
The boy...

00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:21.621
He's the one who cleaned your wound.

00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:22.431
He's good.

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:25.315
They went to the wrech to find supplies.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.236
- AMICIA: I'm so glad they're alive!

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.452
- ARNAUD: They'll be happy to see you.

00:02:31.132 --> 00:02:34.116
Through here. Come.
Take it easy.

00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:36.223
Don't go reopening that wound.

00:02:35.953 --> 00:02:37.073
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:38.943
I think...

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.172
Your potion is starting to work.

00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:43.914
- ARNAUD: To think
I could've killed that bastard Count.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.529
- AMICIA: You couldn't win this one, Arnaud.

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:55.482
It's ruined.

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.332
It will never sail again.

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.156
- ARNAUD: Boats come and go.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.180
But it's the sea
that keeps Sophia's going.

00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:07.942
You know what I mean?

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.394
Focus on what matters to you.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.341
Because when it's gone...

00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:20.886
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:25.611
- ARNAUD: We'll get him back.

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:36.659
- VICTOR: (CLAPS)
The word of a true knight, Arnaud!

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:38.976
- AMICIA: No...

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:42.580
- VICTOR: Really.
I've never seen anything like you.

00:03:42.652 --> 00:03:45.452
- AMICIA: Where's my brother, you bastard!

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:47.437
- VICTOR: Safely in my possession.

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.200
Until he's ready to serve.

00:03:50.574 --> 00:03:53.161
Until he sees your head in a rag.

00:03:53.577 --> 00:03:56.546
And knows this whole world must burn.

00:03:56.626 --> 00:03:58.066
- AMICIA: BASTARD!

00:03:58.086 --> 00:03:59.820
- ARNAUD: I'll handle him.

00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:01.090
- AMICIA: Like hell you will.

00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:02.527
- ARNAUD: Listen to me for once
you damn mule!

00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:04.690
- AMICIA: What?
So that you can have your revenge?

00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:06.357
- ARNAUD: So that you can save your brother.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.520
I'll make him tell us where Hugo is.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.295
Cover my arse and stay alive.

00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:19.388
- VICTOR: I'll handle this one.
Kill the girl!

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:31.783
- SOLDIER: I'm with you, my Lord.
Reinforcements are coming!

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:34.064
- LUCAS: Watch out! They're here!

00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.811
- AMICIA: Lucas! Are you hurt?

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.105
- SOPHIA: No, but we can't move!

00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:39.607
Just stay alive!

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:42.086
- AMICIA: We'll get you out of here.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:43.271
- VICTOR: You're going nowhere!

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.497
- ARNAUD: You stupid bastard!
What have you done with the boy?

00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:50.611
- VICTOR: He's my son now.
My secret weapon!

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.580
- AMICIA: Let us pass!

00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:03.672
- VICTOR: End her! For goodness' sake!

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:09.103
- ARNAUD: Demolish them, girl!
You're tougher than they are.

00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:11.080
- AMICIA: Where did you take my brother?

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:14.780
- ARNAUD: Answer that and I may give you
a quick death! Where's the boy?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.966
- VICTOR: The time for compromises
ended with Emilie. Now you die!

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:34.468
- AMICIA: Why are you all so desperate to die?

00:05:41.392 --> 00:05:45.020
- AMICIA: I'm coming, Hugo.
They can't stop us!

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:47.427
He's my brother!

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:49.357
- ARNAUD: Talk! Where's he?

00:05:49.262 --> 00:05:52.210
- VICTOR: Why would I talk to a dead man?

00:05:54.794 --> 00:05:58.851
- AMICIA: We're losing time, Arnaud.
We must find Hugo before...

00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:00.565
Before Hugo...

00:06:28.332 --> 00:06:30.265
- AMICIA: He thinks I'm dead.

00:06:30.462 --> 00:06:32.757
He gave himself to the Macula.

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:38.156
- ARNAUD: Marseille...

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.833
You took the boy to Marseille
after what happened to your damn island?

00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:42.401
- VICTOR: Shut up!

00:06:42.244 --> 00:06:44.371
I will take care of it!

00:06:48.695 --> 00:06:51.295
- AMICIA: Open your eyes.
It's too late!

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:54.133
Now everyone will die.
And he...

00:06:55.095 --> 00:06:56.095
He...

00:06:56.898 --> 00:06:59.987
Arnaud, we must leave. Now!

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:03.669
- VICTOR: You're not going anywhere.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.126
- SOLDIER 1: (COUGHS)
What is that?

00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:17.444 position:20%
- SOLDIER 2: It's sorcery.
She casts a spell on us!

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:18.439
Kill her! Quick!

00:07:18.486 --> 00:07:21.622
- AMICIA: You damn idiot!
Face the truth for once!

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.400
It's your last chance!

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.226
- VICTOR: Why did you take up arms
with this witch, Arnaud?

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:29.700
To fill the void left by your son?

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.415
- ARNAUD: Do not speak of him!

00:07:31.108 --> 00:07:33.298
His blood is on your hands!

00:07:33.104 --> 00:07:34.992
- VICTOR: It was war!

00:07:35.218 --> 00:07:37.884
- ARNAUD: You abandoned us to the enemy!

00:07:37.736 --> 00:07:42.141
But you can redeem yourself now!
Give a noble command!

00:07:42.343 --> 00:07:45.876
Stop this madness and let the boy go!

00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.793
- VICTOR: Madness makes this world go round.

00:07:48.857 --> 00:07:51.730
But I will fix it my way.

00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:52.805 position:20%
- AMICIA: I'll kill all of you
if I have to!

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.704
You'll have nothing if you don't
give me back my brother!

00:07:54.957 --> 00:07:57.982
- ARNAUD: I'd like so much to kill you!

00:07:58.393 --> 00:08:02.105
But I'll leave just enough of you
to tell me where you hid Hugo.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.280
- VICTOR: So confident!

00:08:03.595 --> 00:08:06.264
- SOLDIER: Sir, we must evacuate now!

00:08:06.074 --> 00:08:10.519
- VICTOR: No! We finish this! Kill the girl!

00:08:10.293 --> 00:08:13.429
- ARNAUD: She's trying to save you, you arseholes!

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.925
- VICTOR: May my faith guide my arms.
May it lead to brighter days.

00:08:16.544 --> 00:08:18.401
Emilie is dead.

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:22.279
She was the only chance
this world was given.

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:26.569
Now you will all kneel before me or die!

00:08:28.497 --> 00:08:30.871
It was a time for peace...

00:08:30.808 --> 00:08:33.452
...but you had to ruin everything!

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:36.174
- AMICIA: Damn idiot! You're just proof
that we don't deserve to live!

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:39.192
You ruined it yourself with your lies!

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.844
- VICTOR: Your technique is sloppy.

00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:45.626
You've spent too much time
training with scum!

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:47.545 position:80% line:20%
- LUCAS: Amicia, this is bad!
We need to reach Hugo fast!

00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:50.135
- AMICIA: I know.
We're doing all we can!

00:08:49.453 --> 00:08:53.074 position:20% line:20%
- SOPHIA: Don't rush her!
Stay alive, Amicia!

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:01.722
- VICTOR: What's the matter?
Is your sword becoming heavy?

00:09:01.278 --> 00:09:02.638
- AMICIA: Arnaud?

00:09:02.232 --> 00:09:05.637
- ARNAUD: Don't worry about me!
I'll be fine!

00:09:08.134 --> 00:09:11.070
- VICTOR: Look at you!
Just give up!

00:09:11.288 --> 00:09:13.234
- AMICIA: Arnaud! Hold on!

00:09:13.028 --> 00:09:16.120
- ARNAUD: I've got him!
Give them hell!

00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:38.821
- SOPHIA: Arnaud!

00:09:41.265 --> 00:09:42.625
- AMICIA: Arnaud!

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:46.655
- VICTOR: This is it! You're too old, Arnaud.
Too old to fight!

00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:50.839
- ARNAUD: And you're so goddamn stupid!

00:09:50.439 --> 00:09:52.773
Amicia, he's yours!

00:09:54.832 --> 00:09:56.512
- AMICIA: It's over!!!

00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:09.317
What can I do?

00:10:09.684 --> 00:10:11.817
- ARNAUD: You can stop shouting.

00:10:11.869 --> 00:10:13.549
- AMICIA: Sorry, I...

00:10:15.383 --> 00:10:17.065
Please, don't...

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.510
No...

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.889
- ARNAUD: It's the right time.

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:30.717
And...

00:10:32.028 --> 00:10:34.095
You gave me quite the last run.

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.271
He's a great boy.

00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:48.047
And you...

00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:50.204
- AMICIA: I know.

00:10:51.148 --> 00:10:52.428
- ARNAUD: You...

00:11:28.127 --> 00:11:30.127
- LUCAS: It will kill the sun.

00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:31.673
The Nebula.

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:39.699
- SOPHIA: You did it.

00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:40.829
You idiot.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:44.115
Now we all... owe you.

00:11:50.808 --> 00:11:52.488
- LUCAS: It's everywhere.

00:11:53.843 --> 00:11:55.910
The rats will spread unchecked.

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:06.153
This is his judgement.

00:12:07.387 --> 00:12:09.520
- AMICIA: Do we still have time?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.253
- LUCAS: Does it matter?
Let's just go!

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.330
- SOPHIA: Make room.
I will take the reins.

00:12:16.454 --> 00:12:18.134
I have to do something.

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:39.148
- LUCAS: How far are we from Marseille?

00:12:38.502 --> 00:12:40.569
- SOPHIA: Not too far, I'd say.

00:12:42.372 --> 00:12:43.372
Amicia...

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:44.793
Are you alright?

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:46.572
- AMICIA: No... I could've...

00:12:46.493 --> 00:12:48.173
- LUCAS: You couldn't!

00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:50.709
I don't even know
how you're even standing.

00:12:51.056 --> 00:12:54.303
- SOPHIA: You did all you could
and he knew it, Amicia.

00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:56.881
Besides, you gave him what he needed most.

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:58.420
- AMICIA: The Count's death.

00:12:57.791 --> 00:12:58.831
- SOPHIA: No.

00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:00.561
Someone to care for.

00:13:01.018 --> 00:13:02.218
A real purpose.

00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:03.424
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:06.306
Yes... He gave his life for us.

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:08.339
I won't let it be for nothing.

00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:10.431
Now we need to find out where Hugo is.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.669
- SOPHIA: That's the problem.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.349
Marseille is a damn big city.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:15.607
- LUCAS: The birth of the Nebula
probably left marks.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.329
Whatever's happening over there
Hugo must be at the central of it.

00:13:19.155 --> 00:13:22.055
- AMICIA: How can we know...
He's still alive?

00:13:21.872 --> 00:13:23.672
- LUCAS: There'll be signs.

00:13:23.723 --> 00:13:24.723
I hope...

00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:32.397
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

00:13:31.942 --> 00:13:33.222
- SOPHIA: Wow...

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.399
That kind of sign?

00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:36.026
- AMICIA: Yes... It's him!

00:13:36.628 --> 00:13:39.495
- LUCAS: But I don't think
it's a good sign.

00:13:38.073 --> 00:13:39.073
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

00:13:39.612 --> 00:13:41.292
- MAN: What's that noise?

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.367
Is it... coming from the city?

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:45.882
- WOMAN: It's coming from the ground!

00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:55.269
- WOMAN 2: Run! Something terrible
happened in the city!

00:13:55.466 --> 00:13:57.533
- LUCAS: What... What happened?

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:04.349
- SOPHIA: What's that damn rumble?

00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:11.780
- LUCAS: It's... the final chant...

00:14:11.843 --> 00:14:13.203
...of the Macula.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.580
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:21.666
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:28.666
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.151
- AMICIA: Marseille...

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:35.401
- SOPHIA: They're barricading the gate.

00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:36.242
Why?

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:37.832
- LUCAS: Because that rumble.

00:14:37.595 --> 00:14:39.728
It's coming from the other side.

00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:43.381
- WOMAN 3: What about those still inside?

00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:45.705
- WOMAN 4: They're dead already.
Keep going.

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:48.606
What do we do?

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:53.148
- SOPHIA: There's another gate further on
with that hays in the way.

00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:54.612
- AMICIA: Wait, we have this canon.

00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:56.056
- LUCAS: You know how it works?

00:14:55.819 --> 00:14:57.510
- AMICIA: I don't know. Wait.

00:14:57.352 --> 00:14:59.552
You push here... That must be it.

00:14:59.427 --> 00:15:01.360
I've figured it out, I think.

00:15:01.414 --> 00:15:03.094
- SOPHIA: Go on, then.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:09.529
- LUCAS: Is that... Greek fire?

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.556
- AMICIA: Yes. The Count recovered some carts
built by the Order.

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:16.477
- SOPHIA: So we're going...
behind these walls?

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:18.652
- LUCAS: Don't think about it now.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.340
- AMICIA: Let's go, Sophia.

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:20.546
- SOPHIA: Here we go again!

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.292
- LUCAS: Those tremors are not
coming from the ground.

00:15:35.741 --> 00:15:38.813
- SOPHIA: No. They're coming
from the city walls.

00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:40.904
- AMICIA: It feels like a heartbeat.

00:15:41.342 --> 00:15:43.076
His heart commanding them.

00:15:43.114 --> 00:15:45.380
- LUCAS: Can you imagine how many?

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:47.472
- AMICIA: So this is how it starts.

00:15:47.102 --> 00:15:48.302
- SOPHIA: What?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.680
- AMICIA: Our punishment.

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.128
- SOPHIA: WHAT THE HELL?

00:15:50.147 --> 00:15:51.147
- LUCAS: NO!

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.212
- AMICIA: FASTER, SOPHIA! FASTER!!!

00:15:52.942 --> 00:15:53.784
- LUCAS: Use it NOW!

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.069
STAY BACK!!

00:15:56.182 --> 00:15:57.862
- LUCAS: It's working!

00:15:57.341 --> 00:16:00.241
- AMICIA: For now.
But there's far too many!

00:15:59.747 --> 00:16:02.266
- SOPHIA: Corner! Hang on!

00:16:03.406 --> 00:16:05.247
- AMICIA: Goddammit!

00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:06.562
- LUCAS: Oh goodness!

00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:08.673
- AMICIA: They're not stopping!

00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:12.247
- LUCAS: They're all here.
This really is the end.

00:16:12.122 --> 00:16:14.487
- AMICIA: We're not going fast enough!

00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:16.382
- SOPHIA: Horses can't go any faster!

00:16:16.411 --> 00:16:18.091
- LUCAS: Way too close!

00:16:20.528 --> 00:16:23.261
- SOPHIA: Aqueduct!
It may slow them down.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.817
- LUCAS: I hope so!
Please please! Slow down!

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.184
- AMICIA: Hold hold HOLD!

00:16:32.436 --> 00:16:33.796
- LUCAS: It held!

00:16:33.628 --> 00:16:35.895
- SOPHIA: They're done chasing us?

00:16:36.901 --> 00:16:38.581
- AMICIA: Looks like it.

00:16:38.987 --> 00:16:41.065
What? BREACH!

00:16:41.162 --> 00:16:43.273
- LUCAS: Go, Sophia! GO!

00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:45.210
- SOPHIA: I see the gate!

00:16:44.846 --> 00:16:47.179
- AMICIA: Too late! Go as far as...

00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:05.935
- AMICIA: Hugo...

00:17:08.979 --> 00:17:09.979
(GROANS)

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:15.959
Sophia?

00:17:16.308 --> 00:17:17.908
- SOPHIA: Over here.

00:17:24.022 --> 00:17:25.702
- AMICIA: Who's wounded?

00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:27.401
- SOPHIA: Who's not?

00:17:34.176 --> 00:17:35.776
- LUCAS: We're here.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.130
- AMICIA: I've never been to Marseille.

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:41.175
- SOPHIA: Oh...

00:17:41.684 --> 00:17:43.550
You came in a lovely season.

00:17:47.007 --> 00:17:49.340
- AMICIA: Let's go find my brother.
