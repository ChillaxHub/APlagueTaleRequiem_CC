00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:41.734
V - IN OUR WAKE

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:57.641
- JOSEPH: I heard the same thing
happened in Guyenne.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:58.969
The rats...

00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:01.778
The <i>Bite</i> that poisons your blood.

00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.311
It seemed far from us.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.696
- HUGO: Bird... Wait...

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:21.731
- LUCAS: Hey...

00:01:21.578 --> 00:01:22.938
Are you dreaming?

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.414
- HUGO: Are we there?

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:27.346
- LUCAS: No, but it shouldn't be long.

00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:37.093
- AMICIA: Hey...

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:40.442
Don't look at that.

00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:41.764
- HUGO: Why not?

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:43.791
It won't make them go away.

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:45.178
It won't undo it.

00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:47.296
- AMICIA: Hugo, you were having a seizure.

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:50.859
- HUGO: I don't want to go to Marseille.
More people will die, you know it!

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:51.766
- AMICIA: Mother wants you to...

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:52.516
- HUGO: No!

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:53.859
The island.

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:57.914
It's where I must go.
It's where I will be fixed, Amicia.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.015
We can find it, please!

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.593
Nobody listens!

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:06.265
I told Mother I felt unwell
but the Magister shushed me.

00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:08.531
He said that it was part of the test.

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.625
Mother and the Magister
they think they know but they don't.

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.909
And people died...

00:02:12.938 --> 00:02:14.218
Because of me...

00:02:13.813 --> 00:02:15.493
- AMICIA: Hey hey hey...

00:02:15.297 --> 00:02:16.297
I know.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.594
I will do what's good for you.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.609
I will.

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:36.211
- BÉATRICE: Lucas...

00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.074
Go see the captain with Hugo.

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:38.917
- LUCAS: Sure.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.390
- BÉATRICE: He will show you
how to pilot the boat.

00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:49.750
- LUCAS: I'll ask him
if he can teach us sailor's knots.

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:52.449
And maybe he'll let us steer.

00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:54.078
- HUGO: Yes.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.932
- BÉATRICE: We need
to get him to safety, Amicia.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.474
- AMICIA: You want to lock him away again.
It's not the same thing.

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.172
- BÉATRICE: You've seen what happens.

00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:16.537
The Order has people and equipment.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.152
They know how to handle this.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.755
- AMICIA: This... happened because of
what you and this Vaudin did to Hugo.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.578
Mother...

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:28.078
Shutting him away and keeping up
with this torture will kill him

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:31.056
He's a child, he's a victim of all this too.

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:32.238
- BÉATRICE: He's <i>my chilld</i>!

00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:34.706
We are not enemies, Amicia.

00:03:36.547 --> 00:03:42.234
I know you love Hugo dearly and I know
you two share a bond that I cannot truly understand.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.676
But you need to open your eyes.

00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:48.148
What happened back there will happen again.

00:03:49.422 --> 00:03:51.102
- AMICIA: You're right.

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:53.952
You just don't understand.

00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:58.713
- JOSEPH: The debris!
It's all piled up here.

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:03.177
- AMICIA: I'm going to take a look.

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:15.099
- LUCAS: I think I see the problem.

00:04:14.422 --> 00:04:17.155
- AMICIA: We'll take care of it together.

00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:20.672
- JOSEPH: Alright, kids.
I'll let you handle this.

00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:22.855
- AMICIA: Hey.

00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.115
You can go back inside if you want.

00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:26.586
- HUGO: No, it's alright.

00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:30.191
- AMICIA: I won't let you down.
I told you.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.775
For now, we'll get that boat moving.

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:34.883
But it's not over yet.

00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:37.071
- HUGO: Yes... Go on.

00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:39.397
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.230
- LUCAS: Look.

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:25.789
There's a lot of debris stuck under the hull.

00:05:25.094 --> 00:05:26.534
Do we pull it out?

00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:28.412
- AMICIA: That would take too long.
Maybe we can just push it?

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.253
- LUCAS: Well... Let's try.

00:05:30.188 --> 00:05:31.468
- AMICIA: Ready?

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:31.759
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:36.750
- AMICIA: Then... Push!
(EFFORT GRUNTS)

00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:39.804
- JOSEPH: Oh shit! You'll have to catch up.

00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:40.511
- LUCAS: What?

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.247
- HUGO: Amicia!

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:42.625
Follow us!

00:05:42.297 --> 00:05:45.097
- BÉATRICE: We'll wait for you downstream.

00:05:44.563 --> 00:05:46.906
- AMICIA: Come on. Let's find a way around.

00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:49.859
- LUCAS: Well, I hope
Joseph will find a way to stop.

00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:04.268
(CROWS CRAWLING)

00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:09.953
- AMICIA: There're so many dead.

00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:11.665
They didn't deserve this.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.040
- LUCAS: It's a tragedy.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.015
I've never thought that...

00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:16.562
- AMICIA: It's too late for that.

00:06:16.672 --> 00:06:18.192
But... this island.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.531
Hugo said it will fix all this.

00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:21.891
So we'll.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.790
- LUCAS: How?

00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:25.015
- AMICIA: The question is: <i>where</i>?

00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:26.551
We have to find it.

00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:27.640
- LUCAS: What about your mother?

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.930
- AMICIA: I don't care.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.812
But you will have to pick a side.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:31.735
- LUCAS: She's...

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:33.185
...my Magistra.

00:07:12.453 --> 00:07:14.187

00:07:14.828 --> 00:07:15.828
Follow me.

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:21.579
Here's the river.

00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:26.122
There they are.

00:07:27.703 --> 00:07:29.143
- LUCAS: Goodness.

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.831
It's even worse from above.

00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:32.794
- AMICIA: That smell is terrible.

00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:36.000
We must take Hugo away from this.

No no no!

- LUCAS: Well... Where do we start?

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:45.031
- AMICIA: There're braziers on the other side.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.110
That bale of hay looks like it would burn...

00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:01.853
Come on, run!

Whew... Alright... That's the first step.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.969
- LUCAS: We're surrounded.

00:09:10.703 --> 00:09:12.837
- AMICIA: There has to be a way.

With those cranks...

00:09:14.063 --> 00:09:15.103
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:09:15.558 --> 00:09:18.091
If they can move rubble around then...

00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:19.804
And this one has a crank!

00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:21.390
- AMICIA: We should give it a try.

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:29.672
Lucas, that's the job for you.

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:30.495

00:09:32.688 --> 00:09:33.728
It's working.

The hay's moving.

00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:37.343
- AMICIA: Yes, this could allow us to cross.

00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:42.041
You saw that hole...
What they're capable of now.

00:09:41.938 --> 00:09:44.338
- LUCAS: They tore down entire city.

00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:48.335
- AMICIA: It will happen again
if we keep ignoring Hugo's feelings.

00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:53.938
Hay won't be enough...

00:09:53.578 --> 00:09:54.618

I think I can help you across.

- LUCAS: Yes, try to move
that hay bale towards me.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.540
I'll be able to light it.

- AMICIA: It's coming...
All this mess just to get to Marseille.

- LUCAS: It's truly worth it.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.130
- AMICIA: It's not.
And Hugo doesn't believe in it anymore.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.187
- LUCAS: Yes. I can understand
why he feels that way.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.100

He's still scared.

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:50.004
I just grabbed some on the way.

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:51.825
- AMICIA: Well, it saved my life.

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:52.125
Thank you.

00:11:52.016 --> 00:11:54.906
- LUCAS: I expected sparks but... not this.

00:11:54.953 --> 00:11:56.393
- AMICIA: I'll need more.

00:11:56.047 --> 00:11:58.180
- LUCAS: Keep an eye out for it.

00:11:57.406 --> 00:11:59.797
- AMICIA: Alright. My turn to get you across.

00:12:24.219 --> 00:12:26.343
Oh... it seems to go all the way around.

00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:27.169
Hang on, Lucas.

00:12:27.016 --> 00:12:28.696
- LUCAS: Take your time.

00:12:28.578 --> 00:12:30.978
As long as they won't climb up here.

00:12:45.656 --> 00:12:46.776
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:12:49.516 --> 00:12:51.249
Come on, come on, come on!

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:53.938
Made it!

00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:55.364
- LUCAS: Well done.

00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:57.431
See anything that can get me to you?

00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:01.382
- AMICIA: This'll do nicely.

00:13:04.313 --> 00:13:05.993
- LUCAS: Yes, nice throw.

00:13:06.063 --> 00:13:07.743
- AMICIA: Nice catch.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.117
- LUCAS: Alright... My turn.

00:13:09.844 --> 00:13:11.911
Goodness... (BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:13:11.828 --> 00:13:14.234
- AMICIA: You can make it, just keep running.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.359
- LUCAS: Yes... They're just rats, huh...

00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:18.625
I know rats... Yes...

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.172
So what am I waiting for?

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:22.235
There...

00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:23.984
Go... Go!

00:13:24.031 --> 00:13:25.031
Yahhhhh...

00:13:25.047 --> 00:13:26.687
- AMICIA: Run! Don't think!

00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:27.961
- LUCAS: Not thinking...

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:30.593
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh...

00:13:30.906 --> 00:13:33.453
- AMICIA: Yes, you run pretty fast.

00:13:33.578 --> 00:13:35.390
- LUCAS: (PANTING) Thanks.

00:13:35.422 --> 00:13:40.812
(PANTING) There's nothing like... (PANTING)
Good motivation (PANTING)

00:13:45.453 --> 00:13:46.453
I'm stuck!

00:13:46.594 --> 00:13:48.274
This thing is locked.

00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:49.312
- AMICIA: I'll take care of it.

00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:50.968
Now we got another haybale here...

00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:52.446
I light it up, we run.

00:13:52.469 --> 00:13:53.829
- LUCAS: Alright.

00:13:53.344 --> 00:13:54.944
- AMICIA: Stay warm.

00:14:06.188 --> 00:14:07.228
- LUCAS: Now!

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:09.394
- AMICIA: Come on, come on!

00:14:08.828 --> 00:14:12.015
- LUCAS: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...

00:14:21.016 --> 00:14:25.112
- AMICIA: We did it (PANTING)
I like your <i>"battle cry"</i>, by the way.

00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:28.750
- LUCAS: (PANTING)

00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:29.781
Thank you.

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:32.206
It helps me build up speed.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.610
I suppose.

00:14:33.531 --> 00:14:35.211
- AMICIA: We're close.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.500
Breathe.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.265
- LUCAS: I'm... (PANTING) trying...

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.422
- AMICIA: Good... We're almost there.

00:14:43.094 --> 00:14:45.015
- LUCAS: Let's hope Marseille is different.

00:14:44.688 --> 00:14:47.687
- AMICIA: Once the Order gets their hands
on Hugo we'll be too late.

00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:50.369
- LUCAS: Amicia,
they can't all be like Vaudin.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.718
- AMICIA: We can't take the chance
to see if you're right.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.450
- HUGO: Amicia!

00:15:11.516 --> 00:15:12.734
I was scared.

00:15:12.797 --> 00:15:15.859
- AMICIA: You know me... Come on.
I always make it back.

00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:17.754
- BÉATRICE: I told him as much.

00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:20.437
Still, it's good to see you both safe.

00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:23.172
- JOSEPH: Sorry to interrupt,
but we should move on.

00:15:22.828 --> 00:15:24.828
And there's a <i>damn</i> chain blocking us.

00:15:24.688 --> 00:15:26.109
- AMICIA: We'll take care of it.

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:38.218
- LUCAS: The crank here
was connected to the chain.

00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:39.323
- AMICIA: Let's see what it does.

00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:40.892
Lucas, that's your job.

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:42.034
- LUCAS: Naturally.

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:45.389
It controls a ferry.

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:46.727
- JOSEPH: We don't need a ferry!

00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:48.201
We need that chain loose.

00:15:48.086 --> 00:15:50.552
- LUCAS: There's nothing on our side.

00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:50.801
It's stuck!

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.609
- AMICIA: Maybe on the other side.
The ferry could take me there.

00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:56.000
- JOSEPH: It's a bloody mess
under that pontoon.

00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:58.297
There must be something
jamming the chain.

00:15:58.094 --> 00:16:00.361
- LUCAS: How do we get down there?

00:16:00.386 --> 00:16:02.186
- AMICIA: We'll find a way.

00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:04.551
Lucas, can you handle it?

00:16:04.293 --> 00:16:05.813
- LUCAS: Of course.

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:06.516
So...

00:16:06.909 --> 00:16:08.429
Is there a passage?

00:16:08.147 --> 00:16:09.989
- AMICIA: There's a hole.
I'm going in.

00:16:09.862 --> 00:16:11.462
- LUCAS: Be careful.

00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:14.201
- AMICIA: (GASPS) Oh Lord!

00:16:16.153 --> 00:16:17.486
- BÉATRICE: Are you all right?

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:19.519
- AMICIA: I'm... Er... I'm fine!

00:16:19.218 --> 00:16:21.885
- HUGO: There're dead people everywhere!

00:16:21.696 --> 00:16:22.696
Get out!

00:16:22.888 --> 00:16:25.488
- AMICIA: No! It's going to be alright.

00:16:27.637 --> 00:16:29.477
Forgive me! (GASPS)

00:16:33.546 --> 00:16:37.223
(GASPS) No... Oh please, no...

00:16:37.005 --> 00:16:39.783
I'm sorry, I have to do it.

00:16:40.357 --> 00:16:41.877
Please, forgive me.

00:16:42.764 --> 00:16:45.049
I-I must do this.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.089
It's done. Give it a try!

00:16:57.783 --> 00:17:00.641
- LUCAS: You did it!
I'm getting the ferry to you.

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:02.079
- AMICIA: Yes, please!

00:17:01.622 --> 00:17:03.062
- HUGO: Come back!

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.350
- AMICIA: On my way!

00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:05.940
- HUGO: It must have been horrible!

00:17:05.499 --> 00:17:06.619
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.740
- LUCAS: Are you all right?

00:17:12.521 --> 00:17:13.521
Ready?

00:17:13.728 --> 00:17:15.408
- AMICIA: I need air... (EXHALES)

00:17:16.486 --> 00:17:19.686
- LUCAS: Take your time.
Tell me when you're ready.

00:17:19.981 --> 00:17:21.419
- AMICIA: You can stop now.

00:17:21.149 --> 00:17:22.117
- LUCAS: Right.

00:17:21.705 --> 00:17:23.438
- HUGO: I'm sorry, Amicia.

00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:24.826
I'm scared.

00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:27.988
- AMICIA: Don't be.
It's not your fault.

00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:31.478
- BÉATRICE: You'll be alright in Marseille, Hugo.

00:17:31.088 --> 00:17:33.369
- HUGO: I don't want to go to the Order!

00:17:33.447 --> 00:17:36.962
- BÉATRICE: Magiter Vaudin
was not a nice man, I know.

00:17:37.135 --> 00:17:38.935
But this will be different.

00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:40.802
- AMICIA: His island, Mother.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.126
- BÉATRICE: Not now, Amicia!

00:17:41.822 --> 00:17:43.022
- AMICIA: Fine!

00:17:48.372 --> 00:17:51.835
Alright, one way or another,
that chain has to go.

00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:55.721
- JOSEPH: See anything?

00:17:54.963 --> 00:17:56.643
- AMICIA: I'm looking!

00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:02.858
There has to be something here.

00:18:06.307 --> 00:18:07.587
That could work.

00:18:10.072 --> 00:18:12.272
Lucas, get away from the chain...

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.460
- LUCAS: Wow...

00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:16.846
- HUGO: Amicia... No!

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:21.049
- LUCAS: Are you hurt?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.080
- AMICIA: What the hell?

00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:23.639
- BÉATRICE: Answer!

00:18:23.025 --> 00:18:24.545
- AMICIA: I'm fine!

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:26.096
Just almost got crushed.

00:18:25.628 --> 00:18:27.628
- HUGO: How will she get back?

00:18:27.295 --> 00:18:30.659
- JOSEPH: Right, the chain's gone
but so are the pontoons.

00:18:30.407 --> 00:18:32.527
I'll dock at the bridge's floodgate.

00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:34.019
- AMICIA: Lucas, can you make it there?

00:18:33.702 --> 00:18:35.274
- LUCAS: I'll find a way.

00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:36.878
- AMICIA: Alright, I'm on my way.

00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:37.986
- HUGO: Be careful!

00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:38.892
- BÉATRICE: Stay safe!

00:18:38.916 --> 00:18:40.596
- AMICIA: Yes... yes...

00:18:41.947 --> 00:18:46.107
I don't care about being safe...
This is all about Hugo, Mother...

00:18:46.854 --> 00:18:48.720
I know you don't trust me...

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.947
But <i>just</i> listen to him!

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:53.932
Calm down.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.260
Focus.

00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:04.119
Lord... How do I cross that thing.

00:19:04.275 --> 00:19:05.635
Yet another mess.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.681
Calm down.
You're troubled.

00:19:07.963 --> 00:19:10.291
And you know why... The island.

00:19:10.463 --> 00:19:13.619
You're figure it out later.
Stay focused.

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:30.159
Good. That's the step.

00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:39.413
- HUGO: Lucas??

00:19:39.822 --> 00:19:41.681
Where are you??

00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:44.799
- AMICIA: Mother...
Is Lucas still not with you?

00:19:44.729 --> 00:19:47.395
- BÉATRICE: No, we've lost sight of him.

00:19:47.322 --> 00:19:49.522
- AMICIA: How?? What is he doing?

00:20:02.575 --> 00:20:04.775
I should be able to get back now.

00:20:15.939 --> 00:20:17.619
Come here, I need you.

00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:29.901
That should work.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.044
- BÉATRICE: Lucas?

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.780
- AMICIA: Let's go.

00:20:42.447 --> 00:20:44.369
Good. Find an island...

00:20:45.682 --> 00:20:47.548
How're you going to do that?

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.260
Maybe ask Joseph?

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:50.932
Discreetly.

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:16.239
- LUCAS: Help!

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.705
- AMICIA: What the hell?

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:21.644
- JOSEPH: Oh no! There're those men!

00:21:22.604 --> 00:21:24.337
- AMICIA: Leave him alone!

00:21:23.729 --> 00:21:27.569
- JOSEPH: Just aim and shoot!
Use the crank handle to reload.

00:21:26.979 --> 00:21:28.419
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.905 line:20%
- LUCAS: Let me go!

00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:31.936
- AMICIA: How do you like that?

00:21:31.479 --> 00:21:33.400
- AMICIA: Lucas! Are you alright?

00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:36.027
- LUCAS: I'm... I'm shaking like hell!

00:21:36.749 --> 00:21:37.749
Thank you!

00:21:37.622 --> 00:21:40.422
There're too many rats!
I can't get to you!

00:21:40.604 --> 00:21:43.010
- BÉATRICE: Amicia, clear a path for him.

00:21:42.619 --> 00:21:43.739
- AMICIA: How?

00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:45.462
- BÉATRICE: Place an Ignifer
on the tip of your bolts.

00:21:45.557 --> 00:21:47.337
Fire them into anything wooden.

00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:48.884
It will keep the bolt burning.

00:21:48.697 --> 00:21:49.897
- AMICIA: Sure.

00:21:49.588 --> 00:21:52.455
Lucas, I'll tell you when the way is clear.

00:21:51.854 --> 00:21:53.134
- LUCAS: Got it!

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.416
Yes, that will do.

00:22:01.494 --> 00:22:03.561
I can almost see a way through.

00:22:04.463 --> 00:22:06.396
- AMICIA: Done. You can come.

00:22:06.072 --> 00:22:09.166
- LUCAS: Yes... Brillian... On my way...

00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:13.196
- AMICIA: Are you alright?

00:22:12.588 --> 00:22:15.455
- LUCAS: Yes... I think my blood is frozen.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.334
But thank you for not missing.

00:22:17.682 --> 00:22:20.478
They were from the same group
as in the arena, Amicia.

00:22:20.541 --> 00:22:22.353
- BÉATRICE: What happened in the arena?

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.853
And who is this Arnaud?

00:22:23.572 --> 00:22:25.587
- JOSEPH: He's a big problem you have now.

00:22:25.463 --> 00:22:26.583
We must leave!

00:22:28.284 --> 00:22:28.861
(HORSE SNORES)

00:22:28.885 --> 00:22:31.893
- ARNAUD: So here's
the famous girl with the sling.

00:22:32.781 --> 00:22:37.133
But it seems you're pretty versatile
when it comes to killing my men.

00:22:37.447 --> 00:22:39.127
- AMICIA: Let's go, now!

00:22:42.275 --> 00:22:43.395
- ARNAUD: Yeah...

00:22:43.682 --> 00:22:44.682
Try that.

00:22:47.775 --> 00:22:49.455
- JOSEPH: This is bad!

00:22:48.854 --> 00:22:50.534
- HUGO: What's going on?

00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:54.574
- JOSEPH: What did you do to them?

00:22:54.225 --> 00:22:56.187
- AMICIA: I just defended myself!

00:22:58.634 --> 00:23:00.793
- BÉATRICE: Amicia, come inside with us!

00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:02.948
- AMICIA: No! Someone has to cover Joseph.

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:05.823
- BÉATRICE: Don't be foolish!
There're too many of them!

00:23:05.316 --> 00:23:07.696
- AMICIA: It's fine!
Don't worry about me!

00:23:12.234 --> 00:23:14.034
- HUGO: Be careful, Amicia!

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:17.190
- AMICIA: I will. Keep hiding.
We'll get through it.

00:23:19.449 --> 00:23:20.702
- JOSEPH: On your right!

00:23:20.386 --> 00:23:22.782
- AMICIA: On it!
Ha! Who's next?

00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:38.605
We gotta get away from here!

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.333
- JOSEPH: Damn! They blocked us!

00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:42.327
Shoot that cart on fire.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.230
Use your... fire bolt...
They're coming!

00:23:43.941 --> 00:23:46.207
- AMICIA: Burn... Burn! Goddammit!

00:23:47.982 --> 00:23:49.662
It's taking too long!

00:23:54.364 --> 00:23:56.855
- BÉATRICE: Amicia! Come here, NOW!

00:23:56.729 --> 00:23:58.409
- AMICIA: Enough, Mother!

00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:02.970
There we go.
How do you like that?

00:24:02.558 --> 00:24:04.825
- JOSEPH: Lord... this is madness!

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.210
More on the right!

00:24:09.939 --> 00:24:12.605
<i>The Wall</i> is sending everything he's got!

00:24:11.998 --> 00:24:13.731
You've started a damn war!

00:24:13.823 --> 00:24:15.506
- AMICIA: I never asked for this!

00:24:15.364 --> 00:24:17.964
But I'll end this Arnaud pig if I must!

00:24:19.217 --> 00:24:22.249 line:20%
- SOLDIER: We'll get them at the bridge!
Tell the men they're coming!

00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:24.535
- AMICIA: Do that!
Tell them they're already dead!

00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:28.979

- AMICIA: They're an army.

00:24:36.978 --> 00:24:38.644
- JOSEPH: More than you can kill!

00:24:37.946 --> 00:24:39.834
- AMICIA: Burn in hell! All of you!

00:24:39.565 --> 00:24:42.637
That's for me and my brother!
And all the others!

00:24:42.822 --> 00:24:44.756
- JOSEPH: Alright, alright...

00:24:44.354 --> 00:24:46.034
That was all impressive.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.619
But you should calm down a bit.

00:24:53.447 --> 00:24:55.047
We're out of the gorge.

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:56.419
Current's getting stronger.

00:24:56.807 --> 00:24:59.369
- AMICIA: Focus on the bar
and leave them to me.

00:24:58.994 --> 00:25:03.090
- JOSEPH: You're doing good, lady.
That crossbow was made for you.

00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:04.581
- AMICIA: No!

00:25:05.056 --> 00:25:06.923
- BÉATRICE: What's going on?

00:25:06.604 --> 00:25:10.060

Get back inside. Protect Hugo.

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:29.735

I'm gonna free the boat!

- BÉATRICE: Enough! They'll kill you!

00:25:32.386 --> 00:25:34.252
- AMICIA: They'll die first!

00:25:36.897 --> 00:25:39.431
Go back inside unless you wanna fight!

00:25:40.489 --> 00:25:42.886
You stay away from my family!

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.407
Stay back! I'll kill the lot of you!

00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:50.186 line:20%

We'll get the rest later!

00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:02.532 position:80% line:20%

She's alone!

00:26:02.556 --> 00:26:05.291

Where's this Arnaud?

00:26:05.072 --> 00:26:06.306
Come face me!

00:26:23.305 --> 00:26:26.633
- SOLDIER: Come on people!
She's just one crazy girl!

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.560

00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:50.171
That's all of them.
Now... yes... Free the boat...

Cut those ropes.

- ARNAUD: Not that easy!

00:27:22.916 --> 00:27:24.947
So what will you do now?

00:27:25.025 --> 00:27:26.225
- AMICIA: No...

00:27:28.963 --> 00:27:30.643
- ARNAUD: I'm here...

00:27:30.502 --> 00:27:33.941
Now show me how you fight
a fully armoured warrior.

00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:37.068
Why are you running?
I came for you!

00:27:34.264 --> 00:27:36.397
- AMICIA: Can't hurt him... Run!

00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:39.026
- AMICIA: The boat... Lose him...
Come back for the ropes.

00:27:36.815 --> 00:27:38.415
- ARNAUD: Just like you asked.

00:27:38.963 --> 00:27:41.576
- ARNAUD: Look at you!
So unprepared!

00:27:41.998 --> 00:27:46.079
You're good at killing.
I'll give you that! But what now?

00:27:47.057 --> 00:27:49.525

Keep... moving...

00:27:54.869 --> 00:27:57.769
- ARNAUD: If you kill,
be ready to be killed.

00:27:57.791 --> 00:27:59.311
It's only fair, no?

00:28:02.291 --> 00:28:03.971
- AMICIA: Don't... panic!

00:28:08.697 --> 00:28:11.297
Stop shaking!
Don't let him get to you!

00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:16.319
Hah... Go back...
You can still do this!

00:28:18.132 --> 00:28:19.560
The boat... Yes!

00:28:19.666 --> 00:28:21.666
- ARNAUD: Ha! Enjoy the view.

00:28:21.838 --> 00:28:24.322
- AMICIA: No... No!
Go to hell!

00:28:25.557 --> 00:28:29.353
- ARNAUD: What's the matter?
I thought you wanted to die?

00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:31.328
That's it!

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.273
Bury yourself.
Just like you.

00:28:34.474 --> 00:28:36.154
I'll catch you anyway.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.075

Come out. I won't hurt you!

00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:11.423
I promise.

00:29:11.447 --> 00:29:13.744
- AMICIA: Need to get to the boat before him.

00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:16.038
Move damn quick. Don't let him...

Do something, now!

00:29:34.015 --> 00:29:37.023

I'm too far away...
No! If you touch them... I...

00:30:36.322 --> 00:30:38.256
If you want to be reckless...

00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:40.096
...be better than that.
