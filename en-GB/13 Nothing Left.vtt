00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:55.621
Say something.

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:01.104
Look at me... Please...

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:03.863
I need you.

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.728
- LUCAS: Amicia, we can't stay here.

00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:10.597
- AMICIA: He won't talk to me.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.744
- LUCAS: We need to leave.

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:15.837
- AMICIA: Hugo, answer me.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.128
- LUCAS: Amicia, we need to leave!

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.507
- AMICIA: To go where?

00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.761
- LUCAS: The harbour.

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:22.074
We're leaving this place.

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:26.996
- AMICIA: I want... rest.

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.314
- LUCAS: You can rest when you're safe.

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:35.321
- AMICIA: We will never be, Lucas. Never!

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:38.415
There can be no peace for us...

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:40.963
Look at him.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.488
- LUCAS: I'll lead the way.

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:50.138
Don't think, just follow me.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:54.715
I'll be your path,
for the both of you.

00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:58.152
I'll carry you if I must.

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:01.380
But I'm taking you out of here.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:09.293
Take a deep breath and stand up.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:13.567
You did it.

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:17.141
Come on, Hugo.

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.369
Good.

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.090
I'm taking you out of here.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.542
- AMICIA: (GROANS)

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:07.735
- LUCAS: Is it the arm?

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:09.731
- AMICIA: Shoulder.

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:12.707
- LUCAS: We have to fix it.

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:16.755
- AMICIA: Do it.

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:20.176
- LUCAS: Don't move.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.849
It's gonna hurt.

00:03:36.944 --> 00:03:38.224
Are you alright?

00:03:42.758 --> 00:03:43.758
Come on.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.760
Hugo.

00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:55.175
Let's go.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.974
- AMICIA: (GROANS) Breathe...

00:05:10.262 --> 00:05:12.595
- LUCAS: There has to be a way out.

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:19.349
Look! Up there! An opening!

00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:20.788
It's our way out.

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.032
- AMICIA: How do we...?

00:05:21.636 --> 00:05:24.781
- LUCAS: The upper floor.
There may be things up there we can use.

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:27.228
- AMICIA: I'll look. Stay with him.

00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:29.241
- LUCAS: Amicia, you're still hurt.

00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:30.724
- AMICIA: Try to bring him back.

00:05:30.654 --> 00:05:31.934
However you can.

00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:33.051
Please...

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:34.972
- LUCAS: Fine.

00:05:34.994 --> 00:05:36.674
But don't go too far.

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:39.678
- AMICIA: Here.

00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:42.311 position:20% line:50%
- LUCAS: Well, Hugo. I think
you can hear me.

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:41.806
Keep going.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.944
- LUCAS: I'm sorry. I need to know
if you're alright.

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:48.224
- AMICIA: Locked.
Can't move this thing from here.

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.261 position:80%
- LUCAS: Skin's pale.

00:05:48.288 --> 00:05:51.245 position:80%
The Macula's mark though.
It looks larger.

Must mirror the spread
inside your mind.

00:05:58.423 --> 00:06:00.103
Let me see your eyes.

00:06:01.512 --> 00:06:03.165
Pupils look dilated.

00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:05.605
You're barely blinking.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.703
- AMICIA: Come on. (GROANS)

00:06:18.773 --> 00:06:21.626
(BREATHES HEAVILY) Hold on.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.137
You have to hold on.

00:06:39.247 --> 00:06:40.666
What a mess...

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:43.463
I can't...

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:48.695
(SOBBING) Oh... please...

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:53.255
Please... How am I going to do this?

00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:58.425
(SOBBING) Please.

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:01.226
(SOBBING) I can't...

00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:03.537
(SOBBING) Help me...

00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:06.269
(SOBBING) Lord...

00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:13.367
(SOBBING)

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.335
Stop... Stop!

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:17.315
(SNIFFS) Stand up!

00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:19.853
Stand up and go!

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:29.907

if you can hear my voice...

00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:38.828 position:20% line:20%
Move one of your fingers.

00:08:00.957 --> 00:08:02.637

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.091
- LUCAS: Wow.

00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:08.959
That's something. Good work!

00:08:08.986 --> 00:08:10.666
We'll try to climb up.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.122
- AMICIA: (GROANS) Yes.

00:08:15.688 --> 00:08:17.555

- AMICIA: How is he?

00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:21.012
- LUCAS: His mind is... extinguished.

00:08:21.278 --> 00:08:23.412
I think it's not just the shock.

00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:24.809
It's the Macula.

00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.448
- AMICIA: So he's not... coming back?

00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:28.601
- LUCAS: Not yet.

00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:30.068

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.251
It's too high!

00:08:56.918 --> 00:08:59.452
- AMICIA: There's no other way, Lucas.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:06.761
- LUCAS: Amicia... Let's push.

00:09:07.302 --> 00:09:08.982

- HUGO: It will kill the sun.

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:45.684

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:50.551
- LUCAS: The Sun Killer...

00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:52.924
The Light Devourer.

00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:55.730
It's the Nebula,
the old texts talk about. It's real!

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.025
- HUGO: I'm home.

00:10:00.612 --> 00:10:02.908

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:04.699
Hugo, look at me!

00:10:05.763 --> 00:10:09.969
- LUCAS: It's not him, Amicia.
It's the Macula talking try to fill the void.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.709
Left by your mother's death.

00:10:13.852 --> 00:10:16.972
- AMICIA: I... I should've saved her... But...

00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:20.779
We can still finish this.

00:10:21.226 --> 00:10:22.586
You hear me Hugo?

00:10:23.585 --> 00:10:25.974
We can fight that bastard Count!

00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:27.133
And kill him!

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:28.966
- LUCAS: No, enough!

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.728
Amicia, we need to leave this damn rock
and take him away from here.

00:10:34.832 --> 00:10:37.810
He's drowning...
Amicia, focus!

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.870
You need to push back.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.072
Talk to him.
Keep him afloat.

00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:46.400
He needs you.

00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:49.323
Alright.

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:40.929
Stay away from those fumes.

00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:43.091
- AMICIA: (COUGHS) It burns!

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:50.212

00:11:50.891 --> 00:11:52.571

- LUCAS: I told you!

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:30.089
His bond with the Macula
is getting stronger.

- AMICIA: I know you're still there, Hugo.

00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:33.533
Please, hold.

We need to be more careful.

something ahead.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.883
- LUCAS: I see it.
What the hell?

00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:31.682
It cannot be...

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:34.749
- LUCAS: We did it, Hugo.

00:40:34.872 --> 00:40:35.992
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:40:36.206 --> 00:40:37.206
Breathe...

00:40:37.396 --> 00:40:38.830
Calm down now.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.840
Let's free Arnaud, right?

00:40:40.684 --> 00:40:42.857
- ARNAUD: Yes... please...

00:40:54.506 --> 00:40:55.946
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:41:08.501 --> 00:41:10.501
- LUCAS: Hugo says it was his.

00:41:32.521 --> 00:41:33.881
- AMICIA: Sophia!

00:41:36.564 --> 00:41:39.572
- SOPHIA: You took your sweet time!
Come aboard.

00:41:42.307 --> 00:41:43.987
Go collapse somewhere.

00:41:45.678 --> 00:41:46.678
Wait.

00:41:47.265 --> 00:41:48.545
And your mother?

00:41:49.643 --> 00:41:51.509
- HUGO: She won't come back.

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:55.042
- AMICIA: We must go. Now.

00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:59.039
- SOPHIA: I see...
I'll take it from here.

00:41:59.465 --> 00:42:00.876
You. Come.

00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.224
- HUGO: She's never coming back.

00:42:09.805 --> 00:42:11.165
- AMICIA: I know.

00:42:13.384 --> 00:42:15.584
- HUGO: I-I wanted to tell her...

00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:17.781
...a lot of things.

00:42:18.111 --> 00:42:19.471
- AMICIA: Me too.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.368
But she knew.

00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:24.283
Everything... already.

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:28.460
You're her greatest gift.

00:42:29.337 --> 00:42:31.584
She loved you the way you are.

00:42:31.735 --> 00:42:33.754
The way she made you.

00:42:40.355 --> 00:42:41.886
We will live.

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:45.049
And we will heal.

00:42:50.018 --> 00:42:51.310
The scars...

00:42:52.943 --> 00:42:55.893
We keep them, so that we don't forget,

00:42:56.835 --> 00:42:58.907
So that we can accept.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.677
Until they don't hurt anymore.
