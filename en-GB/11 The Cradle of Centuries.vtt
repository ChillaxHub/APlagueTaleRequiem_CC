00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:50.255
XI - THE CRADLE OF CENTURIES

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.777
- HUGO: They've come here.

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:21.129
Amicia, the people...

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:22.865
It's my fault.

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:24.439
- AMICIA: It's not.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.465
We all know what happened back there.

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:30.113
- SOPHIA: Don't overthink it.
Let's get to the map.

00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:31.905
That's why you came here.

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.801
- AMICIA: This will soon be over, Hugo.

00:01:41.887 --> 00:01:45.065
- AMICIA: The rats will have no choice
but to go to hell.

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:46.611
- HUGO: They'll fight back.

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:49.246
- SOPHIA: They're stupid animals, Hugo.

00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:51.732
We're three smart and strong human beings.

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:54.674
- AMICIA: Sophi...

00:01:54.294 --> 00:01:56.182
- SOPHIA: Let me know
which fire you want to go to.

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:57.878
I'll open a path to it.

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:17.165
- HUGO: The ground?

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:17.829
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:21.357
He has to be down below.
The map could be the entry point.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.152
- SOPHIA: Are we... breaking it?

00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:24.429
- AMICIA: I guess so.

00:08:28.384 --> 00:08:29.904
Stay back, alright.

00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:31.305
Ready?

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.045
Push.

00:08:38.758 --> 00:08:40.118
- SOPHIA: Whoo...

00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:41.787
That was liberating.

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:43.207
- HUGO: Poor map.

00:08:43.987 --> 00:08:48.194
- SOPHIA: But... that's too bad
because it was very old, yes.

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:52.693
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:09:16.413 --> 00:09:17.413
A hallway.

00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:19.646
It's been sealed.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.159
- SOPHIA: Sealed against what?

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.829
- AMICIA: Let's go see it.

00:09:32.063 --> 00:09:33.063
This is it.

00:09:34.952 --> 00:09:35.952
Come.

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:39.309
- HUGO: It's too dark!

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:41.839
- SOPHIA: But the dark is afraid of you too.

00:09:41.617 --> 00:09:44.045
Just one light... and it's gone.

00:09:45.565 --> 00:09:48.232
- AMICIA: Come on, we'll find the light.

00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:03.635
Look, this leads somewhere.

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:05.842
This is it... I feel it.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.192
- SOPHIA: We're the first here
in a long time.

00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:09.475
- HUGO: Don't let go of my hand.

00:10:09.237 --> 00:10:11.304
- AMICIA: I won't. Don't worry.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.677
- HUGO: It's getting darker.

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:33.928
- AMICIA: I'll light it up.

00:10:33.112 --> 00:10:34.792
- SOPHIA: Yes, please.

00:10:42.613 --> 00:10:44.898
- AMICIA: Wait, something's happening.

00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:46.114
- SOPHIA: Oh please... No...

00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:51.146
What the hell?

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:56.678
- AMICIA: Look at the size of this place.

00:10:56.144 --> 00:10:57.824
- HUGO: What is this?

00:10:57.551 --> 00:10:59.751
- SOPHIA: Some sort of... temple?

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:01.526
- AMICIA: It looks like it, yes.

00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:29.956
- SOPHIA: On the ground, look!

00:11:29.718 --> 00:11:31.398
The Order's symbol again?

00:11:31.052 --> 00:11:33.385
- AMICIA: Yes... This is the place.

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:34.795
- HUGO: Basilius' here.

00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:36.164
Somewhere.

00:11:52.961 --> 00:11:54.405
- SOPHIA: Look at that door...

00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:55.911
- AMICIA: What a mess...

00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:57.561
What happened here?

00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:01.462
- SOPHIA: Burnt marks.
There was a blast here.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.104
- HUGO: Was it an accident?

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.591
- AMICIA: I'd say they were blown open.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.099
- SOPHIA: Yes, someone really wanted to get it.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.826
- AMICIA: Let's see the rest.

00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:12.666
- SOPHIA: There was another blast here too.

00:12:12.492 --> 00:12:14.172
The gate is destroyed.

00:12:13.857 --> 00:12:15.657
- AMICIA: It has to be her!

00:12:15.349 --> 00:12:16.349
Aelia.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.839
She escaped the chapel.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.423
- HUGO: She just striked all this?

00:12:19.137 --> 00:12:21.756
- AMICIA: She wanted to take Basilius back.

00:12:21.258 --> 00:12:24.330
She forced her way through...
We're on her trail.

00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:56.376
- SOPHIA: Finally.

00:21:56.729 --> 00:21:57.729
Good work.

00:21:57.761 --> 00:21:58.881
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:00.297
Let's push forward.

00:22:00.598 --> 00:22:01.958
All the guards...

00:22:02.249 --> 00:22:05.149
I can't believe she took them ... by herself.

00:22:04.998 --> 00:22:08.219
- SOPHIA: That girl must've been
a one fiercesome fighter.

00:22:08.063 --> 00:22:09.930
- AMICIA: She was committed.

00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:12.445
He was everything to her.

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:15.566
- HUGO: Something ... was happening here.

00:22:25.065 --> 00:22:27.531
- AMICIA: Lord... I hope she made it.

00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:29.639
Please.

00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:31.269
Give us something.

00:22:35.077 --> 00:22:36.077
So...

00:23:03.681 --> 00:23:05.414
- HUGO: We should go back.

00:23:07.532 --> 00:23:09.999
- SOPHIA: <i>"Protect one, protect all."</i>

00:23:10.695 --> 00:23:13.495
That's the writing from the fort's chapel.

00:23:14.918 --> 00:23:16.438
- AMICIA: It's her.

00:23:17.198 --> 00:23:18.198
Aelia.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.730
The Carrier's Protector.

00:23:24.459 --> 00:23:26.859
- SOPHIA: She really gave them hell.

00:23:29.018 --> 00:23:30.951
- AMICIA: But she died alone.

00:23:34.598 --> 00:23:36.038
What's wrong Hugo?

00:23:36.327 --> 00:23:38.460
- HUGO: I don't want you to die.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.110
- AMICIA: I'm alive.

00:23:40.439 --> 00:23:41.439
I'm alive.

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:43.080
- SOPHIA: Come on.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.460
You're a big boy.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.614
Let's have a look at that door. Hm?

00:23:56.188 --> 00:23:58.321
- AMICIA: I know how it feels...

00:23:59.911 --> 00:24:01.111
Fighting alone.

00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:05.301
Fighting not to be alone.

00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:12.426
I just hope you found peace where you are.

00:24:17.413 --> 00:24:20.282
- SOPHIA: You got any idea
how we're gonna open this?

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:23.661
- HUGO: We should go back.

00:24:23.554 --> 00:24:24.754
- SOPHIA: What?

00:24:24.675 --> 00:24:25.875
After all this?

00:24:26.972 --> 00:24:27.972
Come on.

00:24:30.484 --> 00:24:32.684
- AMICIA: Are you feeling better?

00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:35.846
- SOPHIA: So so.

00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:38.156
- AMICIA: Hey.

00:24:38.363 --> 00:24:39.643
We're all tired.

00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.582
But we're together, right?

00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:49.270
Well...

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.001
Let's open this door.

00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:15.232
A cart? What's it doing here?

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:19.413
Sophia, can you take care of it?

00:25:19.202 --> 00:25:21.002
- SOPHIA: Consider it done.

00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:28.194
- AMICIA: There's a pole attached to it.
It must be for something.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.650
I need your help, Sophia.

00:25:46.547 --> 00:25:47.987
- SOPHIA: Alright.

00:25:53.204 --> 00:25:55.594
- AMICIA: This will open
the top and bottom bars.

00:25:59.283 --> 00:26:02.105
That thing that came out of the ground...
Is that a crank?

00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:03.525
- SOPHIA: I think so.

00:26:04.318 --> 00:26:07.518
- AMICIA: It works.
One bar done. Now for the rest.

00:26:13.157 --> 00:26:14.957
Sophia, can I count on you?

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.890
- SOPHIA: My pleasure.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.103
- AMICIA: Go on, Hugo.

00:26:32.693 --> 00:26:33.813
- HUGO: Uh uh.

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.600
- AMICIA: I think it did the trick.

00:26:43.512 --> 00:26:45.712
We can let go...
You can stop now.

00:26:45.585 --> 00:26:47.265
- SOPHIA: Let's do this.

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:53.289
- AMICIA: It's working.

00:26:52.661 --> 00:26:55.061
- SOPHIA: Yes, this is happening.

00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:58.259
- AMICIA: Ughhh... (COUGHS)
What's that smell?

00:26:58.127 --> 00:27:00.194
- HUGO: It shouldn't be opened.

00:26:59.903 --> 00:27:01.583
We can still close it.

00:27:01.527 --> 00:27:03.794
- AMICIA: No, we'll find Basilius.

00:27:14.484 --> 00:27:16.617
We'll pass that door altogether.

00:27:17.212 --> 00:27:18.212
We're here.

00:27:19.084 --> 00:27:21.151
If you want to go back, Sophia.

00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:22.496
Now it's the time.

00:27:22.395 --> 00:27:23.995
- SOPHIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:27:24.072 --> 00:27:25.072
Let's go.

00:27:25.024 --> 00:27:26.758
- HUGO: I want to go back.

00:27:26.483 --> 00:27:28.163
- AMICIA: Please, Hugo.

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:38.919
(COUGHS)

00:27:40.161 --> 00:27:41.521
- SOPHIA: Urgh...

00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:44.022
What... are we... breathing?

00:27:44.072 --> 00:27:45.752
- AMICIA: Rat's nest.

00:27:45.396 --> 00:27:47.196
But the area's much bigger.

00:27:47.138 --> 00:27:49.220
- HUGO: It's been there a long time.

00:27:48.874 --> 00:27:50.740
- AMICIA: Since... Basilius?

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.160
- HUGO: I think so.

00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:55.498
Oh... I feel...

00:27:55.736 --> 00:27:56.736
funny...

00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.566
- AMICIA: Your head?

00:28:00.362 --> 00:28:02.428
- AMICIA: Courage.
What is that?

00:28:02.078 --> 00:28:04.875
- SOPHIA: This is not welcoming.

00:28:04.915 --> 00:28:06.035
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:28:06.411 --> 00:28:08.011
- AMICIA: Let's see.

00:28:20.223 --> 00:28:22.234
- SOPHIA: That did something, definitely.

00:28:22.651 --> 00:28:24.947
Prepare to run, just in case.

00:28:29.727 --> 00:28:31.407
- HUGO: It's a bridge.

00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:33.774
- SOPHIA: This place
is a goddamn underground fortress.

00:28:33.606 --> 00:28:35.406
- AMICIA: Let's keep going.

00:28:39.223 --> 00:28:41.023
It seems to go all the way.

00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:42.527
- HUGO: There's  a missing piece.

00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:43.681
- AMICIA: Ah... yes...

00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:46.450
- SOPHIA: Look, here... There's a way down.

00:28:46.232 --> 00:28:48.032
Well, it-it's deep, well...

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.030
- AMICIA: Right.

00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:51.296
It could work.

00:28:51.793 --> 00:28:52.993
I'll try first.

00:28:52.795 --> 00:28:54.315
- HUGO: Be careful.

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.604
- AMICIA: Hey.

00:35:21.263 --> 00:35:22.623
- HUGO: You're...

00:35:22.421 --> 00:35:24.327
...here. (SOBBING)

00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:26.780
- AMICIA: What? It's alright.

00:35:26.971 --> 00:35:27.971
Let us go.

00:35:27.702 --> 00:35:30.435
- SOPHIA: Do you want to... take a break?

00:35:30.014 --> 00:35:31.814
- AMICIA: No, we better go.

00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.071
I'm here now.

00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:34.461
Let's go.

00:35:34.334 --> 00:35:35.934
- HUGO: I'm sad...

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.930
...and scared, Amicia.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.880
- AMICIA: I know.

00:35:38.722 --> 00:35:40.402
We've been through a lot.

00:35:42.949 --> 00:35:44.882
- AMICIA: Is it... Basilius'?

00:35:44.949 --> 00:35:46.069
- HUGO: Maybe.

00:35:47.149 --> 00:35:49.349
(PRONOUCE MORE CLEARY, YOU BRAT!)

00:35:50.286 --> 00:35:51.286
I'm scared.

00:35:51.576 --> 00:35:53.679
- SOPHIA: Guess that means
we're getting close.

00:35:53.372 --> 00:35:55.505
- AMICIA: The end of the bridge.

00:35:55.281 --> 00:35:57.215
Time to see where this leads.

00:35:58.974 --> 00:36:01.201
- SOPHIA: Urghh... That smell is...

00:36:01.311 --> 00:36:02.511
...suffocating.

00:36:24.612 --> 00:36:26.612
- SOPHIA: So, he's down there?

00:36:26.715 --> 00:36:27.835
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:36:27.965 --> 00:36:29.645
At the heart of all this.

00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:33.609
It looks like what the last threshold would do.

00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:36.360
Aelia failed to reach him.

00:36:36.472 --> 00:36:38.205
And this is what happened.

00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:39.453
- SOPHIA: But what?

00:36:39.525 --> 00:36:40.645
What happened?

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:42.523
And what happened to him?

00:36:42.563 --> 00:36:43.952
- HUGO: I don't want to know.

00:36:43.674 --> 00:36:45.239
- AMICIA: You have to.

00:36:45.368 --> 00:36:46.968
He brought you here.

00:36:47.328 --> 00:36:48.328
It's...

00:36:49.061 --> 00:36:50.261
...your legacy.

00:36:50.272 --> 00:36:52.272
- HUGO: I don't want a legacy.

00:36:52.206 --> 00:36:53.806
I want to be normal.

00:36:59.604 --> 00:37:02.996
- AMICIA: Hugo...
Before we get things back to normal.

00:37:03.022 --> 00:37:04.400
You <i>must</i> live.

00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:07.816
- HUGO: You want that but
I keep ruining things.

00:37:07.568 --> 00:37:09.976
- AMICIA: But you don't do it on purpose.

00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:12.436
You're... You're a child!

00:37:12.248 --> 00:37:14.906
- HUGO: There were children
in the Red City too!

00:37:14.738 --> 00:37:16.538
- SOPHIA: It's tough, Hugo.

00:37:17.593 --> 00:37:20.393
We don't know each other very well, but...

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:22.238
I know you deserve a second chance.

00:37:22.524 --> 00:37:23.524
Even...

00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:25.628
We have to fight it in hell.

00:37:25.319 --> 00:37:26.439
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:37:32.218 --> 00:37:33.952
I want him out of my head!

00:37:34.505 --> 00:37:36.185
- AMICIA: We're close.

00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:39.331
If he's down there,
so is what can save you.

00:37:39.242 --> 00:37:40.922
- HUGO: What's the point?

00:37:40.963 --> 00:37:43.562
If I keep ruining everything?

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.307
- AMICIA: Stop! You have to trust me!

00:37:45.884 --> 00:37:46.884
- HUGO: I...

00:37:47.189 --> 00:37:48.189
I can't!

00:37:51.975 --> 00:37:53.655
- SOPHIA: Sweetheart!

00:37:53.344 --> 00:37:55.144
- AMICIA: Please... I know!

00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:58.169
- HUGO: No... you don't.

00:37:58.697 --> 00:38:00.377
Why are you doing this?

00:38:01.226 --> 00:38:02.746
- SOPHIA: Amicia...

00:38:02.288 --> 00:38:04.291
- AMICIA: Come, I'll carry you.

00:38:04.361 --> 00:38:06.041
We'll do this together.

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:07.419
- SOPHIA: This is too much.

00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:11.037
- AMICIA: I'm sorry
you have to go through this.

00:38:11.606 --> 00:38:12.886
I do it for you.

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:14.978
- HUGO: I want to rest.

00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:16.411
- AMICIA: You'll have it.

00:38:16.435 --> 00:38:18.446
But you must live first.

00:38:19.014 --> 00:38:20.204
I need you.

00:38:19.986 --> 00:38:22.516
- HUGO: I'm scared of what down there, Amicia.

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.565
- AMICIA: Stop.

00:38:23.506 --> 00:38:24.626
You will live.

00:39:03.657 --> 00:39:05.257
- SOPHIA: Is that...

00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:06.542
The Carrier?

00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:11.739
- AMICIA: The imprisoned him.

00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:14.731
- HUGO: But... why?

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.576
- AMICIA: They were scared of him...
Of his power.

00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:26.238
This is why they built... all this.

00:39:28.605 --> 00:39:30.285
They were always afraid.

00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:33.039
- SOPHIA: They left a child to die.

00:39:34.498 --> 00:39:36.631
- AMICIA: He unleashed the rats.

00:39:36.512 --> 00:39:39.968
They tore through their walls.
They couldn't stop them.

00:39:41.841 --> 00:39:43.121
It started here.

00:39:43.915 --> 00:39:45.115
- SOPHIA: What?

00:39:45.582 --> 00:39:47.649
- AMICIA: The Justinean plague.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.580
- HUGO: He was sad.

00:39:50.043 --> 00:39:52.138
So sad and angry.

00:39:53.585 --> 00:39:56.785
- AMICIA: So that's why
the Macula brought us here?

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.940
It has to be something...

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480
A scroll...?

00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:02.751
A file...?

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980
Something!

00:40:04.056 --> 00:40:05.736
- SOPHIA: I see nothing!

00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:07.991
- AMICIA: Aelia...

00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:09.286
She failed.

00:40:13.806 --> 00:40:15.326
- SOPHIA: Amicia...

00:40:15.576 --> 00:40:17.510
- AMICIA: She failed, Sophia.

00:40:17.342 --> 00:40:18.862
- SOPHIA: I know...

00:40:18.275 --> 00:40:19.875
- HUGO: So unfair...

00:40:20.065 --> 00:40:21.508
When I die...

00:40:21.271 --> 00:40:22.951
- AMICIA: You won't die!

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.727
- HUGO:...I will also kill them all!!

00:40:24.215 --> 00:40:25.735
- AMICIA: No, Hugo.

00:40:25.393 --> 00:40:27.352
He wasn't meant to die.

00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:30.844
When they took him from his Protector...

00:40:30.745 --> 00:40:32.121
He lost hope.

00:40:32.585 --> 00:40:36.335
So he gave into the Macula
and condemned them all.

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.281
- HUGO: He was right!

00:40:37.883 --> 00:40:41.873
- AMICIA: No! That's...
If one word from her had reached him...

00:40:43.424 --> 00:40:45.690
He would've known he wasn't alone.

00:40:46.038 --> 00:40:50.023
He would've lived and spare millions.

00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:53.587
Do you understand?
You <i>won't</i> die!

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.734
I'm here for you...
And I will give you the life you deserve.

00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:59.801
A life without fight.

00:41:00.757 --> 00:41:02.117
Do you want that?

00:41:04.096 --> 00:41:05.962
Let's find ourselves a home.

00:41:06.234 --> 00:41:08.567
- SOPHIA: I don't think they agree.

00:41:08.374 --> 00:41:09.852
- AMICIA: What's going on?

00:41:09.346 --> 00:41:10.754
- SOPHIA: We must get out!

00:41:15.378 --> 00:41:16.610
- AMICIA: Hah... Quick quick!

00:41:16.501 --> 00:41:17.701
- SOPHIA: Move!

00:41:19.408 --> 00:41:20.448
To the right!

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.557
- HUGO: They don't want me to leave!

00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:25.350
- AMICIA: They'll get nothing!

00:41:24.994 --> 00:41:27.660
- SOPHIA: Save your breath!
Stay with me!

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.875
- AMICIA: Hah... No! Up up up! Sophia!

00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:35.555
- SOPHIA: On your left!

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.023
- AMICIA: Yeah... Come on, Hugo!

00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:43.546
Everything's going to collapse!

00:41:43.833 --> 00:41:45.513
- HUGO: They're so angry!

00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:49.939
Oh no, they're not slowing down!

00:41:53.654 --> 00:41:55.588
- AMICIA: We can still do it!

00:42:08.736 --> 00:42:09.936
Come on, quick!

00:42:10.497 --> 00:42:12.017
- HUGO: I'm trying!

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:21.497
- HUGO: Leave us!

00:42:21.427 --> 00:42:22.867
- HUGO: LEAVE US!!

00:42:22.796 --> 00:42:24.514
- AMICIA: Ignore them, Hugo!

00:42:24.237 --> 00:42:25.917
Breathe... Keep running!

00:42:25.792 --> 00:42:27.329
- HUGO: Ur... Sophia?

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.810
- AMICIA: Sophia??

00:42:28.364 --> 00:42:30.044
- SOPHIA: I'm right here!

00:42:29.532 --> 00:42:31.017
- AMICIA: Is there an exit?

00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:32.099
- SOPHIA: Nothing yet!

00:42:32.221 --> 00:42:33.221
Keep going!

00:42:35.906 --> 00:42:36.906
- HUGO: No!

00:42:37.315 --> 00:42:38.135
- AMICIA: What?

00:42:37.918 --> 00:42:39.150
- HUGO: They're coming!

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.409
There're so many!

00:42:40.727 --> 00:42:42.415
- AMICIA: Come on! Come on!

00:42:44.617 --> 00:42:46.617
- AMICIA: Yes... Yes! Finally!

00:42:46.465 --> 00:42:48.798
- SOPHIA: (IN THE DISTANCE)
Come on!

00:42:49.342 --> 00:42:51.681
- HUGO: It's falling! Amicia!

00:42:51.773 --> 00:42:54.439
- AMICIA: Keep running! Don't look back!

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:25.499
(PANTING)

00:43:22.687 --> 00:43:25.343
- SOPHIA: Tell me they're sealed inside.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.287
- AMICIA: I think we're fine.

00:43:27.061 --> 00:43:28.523
Has anyone hurt?

00:43:28.444 --> 00:43:29.444
Hugo?

00:43:29.295 --> 00:43:31.028
- HUGO: It was horrible...

00:43:31.953 --> 00:43:33.073
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:34.769
I'm sorry you had to see that.

00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:36.479
The Macula lured you in.

00:43:36.689 --> 00:43:39.327
- SOPHIA: The Macula
really has a way with children.

00:43:39.203 --> 00:43:41.269
- HUGO: They put chains on him.

00:43:42.624 --> 00:43:43.744
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:44.959
But you'll live.

00:43:45.017 --> 00:43:46.817
That's what most important.

00:43:46.908 --> 00:43:49.808
- HUGO: That's not
what's the most important.

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:53.018
I'm scared to think people at that bad.

00:43:53.312 --> 00:43:55.912
I'm scared of what they'll make me too.

00:43:57.893 --> 00:44:00.026
- AMICIA: You're right...
Listen.

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:03.936
There will always be people
who do terrible things.

00:44:04.054 --> 00:44:05.734
That's how the world is.

00:44:05.967 --> 00:44:08.833
But you have to trust
in your own goodness.

00:44:09.184 --> 00:44:10.864
And goodness of others.

00:44:11.516 --> 00:44:12.796
People who care.

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:14.977
I want you to be happy.

00:44:15.073 --> 00:44:16.073
Friends...

00:44:16.196 --> 00:44:17.636
- SOPHIA: Like me.

00:44:18.678 --> 00:44:21.814
- AMICIA: Friends
make you want to be good, right?

00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:27.110
If you doubt it, I understand.

00:44:27.156 --> 00:44:28.836
But you can trust me.

00:44:29.465 --> 00:44:30.825
You can trust us.

00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:35.352
- HUGO: I trust you.

00:44:36.679 --> 00:44:38.742
- AMICIA: We'll find a place of our own.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:40.470
Let's leave this island.

00:44:40.854 --> 00:44:42.520
- SOPHIA: We have a boat to catch.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.980
And a sea of rats to cross first.

00:44:45.657 --> 00:44:47.590
- AMICIA: They won't stop us.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.100
Everything is different.
