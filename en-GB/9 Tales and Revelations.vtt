You overheard us on the boat, Sophia...

00:19:59.689 --> 00:20:01.369

00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:03.443

Let's go visit those Mothers then.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.790

- SOPHIA: Sanctuary.
That's what I've heard it called.

00:20:52.343 --> 00:20:54.438
And now I'm even more curious about it.

00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:29.955
- SOPHIA: So we've got a magic bird...

00:21:29.686 --> 00:21:31.819
An ancient Order of Alchemist...

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.177
The little one has visions...

00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:36.526

What else can I expect?

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.131
...special.

00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:45.082
Our Mother is an alchemist
but she couldn't do anything about it.

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:46.842
It's almost like...

00:21:47.196 --> 00:21:48.196
A curse.

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.521

00:21:50.347 --> 00:21:52.027
- HUGO: I'm not a baby!

00:21:51.903 --> 00:21:53.837

00:21:54.248 --> 00:21:56.391
This thing goes back to...

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:58.595
...the dawn of times.

00:21:58.502 --> 00:22:00.022
It's unfair, but...

00:22:01.168 --> 00:22:02.848
This is real, Sophia.

00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:06.585
In Guyenne, the Inquisition came after us over this.

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.605
We barely made it here.

00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:10.208

00:22:10.723 --> 00:22:12.403

Alright.

00:22:14.304 --> 00:22:17.248
We'll find what you came for.
You have my word.

00:22:16.765 --> 00:22:18.365
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:22:47.147 --> 00:22:49.614
That's it. The path to the sanctuary.

00:22:49.274 --> 00:22:51.305
- SOPHIA: So we're done here for now?

00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:53.154
- AMICIA: Yes, let's go.

00:22:56.296 --> 00:22:58.096
It's gonna be quite a walk.

00:22:57.645 --> 00:22:58.931
- HUGO: First to the top!

00:22:58.614 --> 00:23:01.514

00:23:01.837 --> 00:23:03.117

Are you tired? We've been walking a while.

00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:33.239

00:24:33.956 --> 00:24:37.066

We're not there yet.

Everything I need is at sea level.

00:24:44.312 --> 00:24:45.992
- HUGO: I like mountains.

00:24:45.662 --> 00:24:48.371
They're big and tall
so when you're on top of it...

00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:49.941
You're big and tall too.

00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:52.343
- AMICIA: You know,
it's his first time climbing one.

00:24:52.418 --> 00:24:56.258

let's be big and tall together.

00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:05.345
Damn, it's getting hot.

00:25:05.425 --> 00:25:08.325

00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:14.867
- AMICIA: Come on. It'll be worth the sweat.
Look at the size of it.

00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:40.003
- SOPHIA: So what do you expect
to find up there?

00:25:39.577 --> 00:25:41.977
- HUGO: I want to see the real bird.

00:25:41.849 --> 00:25:42.849
The tree...

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.008
Or the pond!

00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:46.190
- AMICIA: I prefer an elixir.

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:48.628
Something to really help you, Hugo.

00:25:48.423 --> 00:25:50.281
- HUGO: Maybe the bird will have it.

00:25:50.377 --> 00:25:52.503
Oh, it's spring water.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.590
- SOPHIA: How can you run in this heat?

00:25:54.943 --> 00:25:56.623
- AMICIA: Child's skill.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.916
He can also fall asleep in a snap.

00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:05.268
Hm... It looks so fresh.

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:06.629

00:26:07.027 --> 00:26:08.964
- SOPHIA: Just what I need anyway.

00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:09.675

00:26:09.186 --> 00:26:11.319
You have some dirt on your face.

00:26:10.806 --> 00:26:12.806
- SOPHIA: I'll get it for you.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:14.048
- HUGO: Ah... (LAUGHS)

00:26:14.128 --> 00:26:16.191
Water attack!!!!!

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.000

00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:19.811

(LAUGHTERS)

00:26:21.158 --> 00:26:22.676

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:24.806
I yield. You soaked me to death.

00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:26.631

00:26:40.093 --> 00:26:41.826
- AMICIA: Well done, Hugo.

00:26:41.373 --> 00:26:43.573

00:27:14.247 --> 00:27:15.367

00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:22.527
There are lots, Amicia.

00:27:22.798 --> 00:27:24.317
- GOATKEEPER: Don't be scared!

00:27:27.263 --> 00:27:29.330
- HUGO: Yes... But they scream!

00:27:29.738 --> 00:27:31.065
- AMICIA: I'm here.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.136
- SOPHIA: Well well well...
Our fierce warrior is afraid of goats?

00:27:35.212 --> 00:27:36.946
- HUGO: There're too many!

00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:39.117
- GOATKEEPER: You're heading
to the Child's sanctuary?

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:39.971
- AMICIA: We are.

00:27:39.484 --> 00:27:41.490
- GOATKEEPER: Er...
I'm afraid you're too late.

00:27:41.378 --> 00:27:43.430
They closed that gate, as you can see.

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:44.507
For the ceremony.

00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:45.458
- AMICIA: The ceremony?

00:27:45.215 --> 00:27:48.128
- SOPHIA: Aw... we came
all this way for the little one.

00:27:48.024 --> 00:27:49.464
- GOATKEEPER: Er... well...

00:27:49.305 --> 00:27:52.313
That goat path to the side
will take you closer.

00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:54.218
But you'll have to look from afar.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.259
The Count and Countess are up there and...

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.064
The guards are on edge since yesterday's mess.

00:27:58.868 --> 00:28:01.332
They won't take kindly to uninvited guests.

00:28:01.197 --> 00:28:04.097
- SOPHIA: We'll keep that in mind.
Thank you.

00:28:08.316 --> 00:28:11.014
- GOATKEEPER: Ah by the way...
If you stumble on ...

00:28:11.025 --> 00:28:12.873
Please, send it back here.

00:28:13.157 --> 00:28:14.744
It is one of my goats.

00:28:14.552 --> 00:28:15.719
- AMICIA: We'll try.

00:28:15.742 --> 00:28:16.978
- GOATKEEPER: Good luck then.

00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:19.364
- HUGO: I hope she wouldn't attack us.

00:28:20.022 --> 00:28:22.739
- SOPHIA: Oh come on.
It's a goat not a wolf!

00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:24.465
- HUGO: But they scream!

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:26.525
- AMICIA: Oh they do.

00:28:32.558 --> 00:28:34.632
So they locked down the sanctuary.

00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:35.583
Just our luck.

00:28:35.393 --> 00:28:39.542
- SOPHIA: On the bright side, you don't lock
a place down if it doesn't hold something important.

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:42.251
- AMICIA: Yes... I'm even more curious now.

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:46.759
- HUGO: Listen...

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:48.842
Is that the goat he talked about?

00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:50.589
- SOPHIA: ..., yes.

00:28:51.628 --> 00:28:53.148
- HUGO: She's here.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.681
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:55.729
We should send you back to your owner.

00:28:55.605 --> 00:28:56.965
- SOPHIA: Goat...

00:28:56.845 --> 00:29:00.109
I stared in their eyes for hours
when I was a child.

00:29:00.187 --> 00:29:02.610
You can't know what's going on in there.

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:05.674
- AMICIA: You may just not be ready
for their knowledge.

00:29:15.063 --> 00:29:18.249
- SOPHIA: Wow... This is turning into
an actually rescue mission.

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:20.223
- HUGO: I really hope she's nice.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.244
- AMICIA: I'm sure she'll be thankful.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.813
In... her own way.

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:26.520
- HUGO: If she's not,
we'll lock her up again, won't we?

00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:30.073
- AMICIA: Don't worry... You have
two strong women to protect you.

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:31.239
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.959
There's a hole in the wall.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.200
- AMICIA: Huh... Hey.

00:29:47.013 --> 00:29:48.803
Only <i>you</i> can do it.

00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:50.434
- HUGO: Alright...

00:29:50.638 --> 00:29:52.078
- SOPHIA: My hero!

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.570
- SOPHIA: Here's our fugitive.

00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:12.467
- AMICIA: You saved her, Hugo.

00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:14.196
Want to say a proper hello?

00:30:14.004 --> 00:30:15.124
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:30:21.907 --> 00:30:23.099
- AMICIA: I'll go with you.

00:30:22.925 --> 00:30:26.816
- SOPHIA: You've done a difficult part.
Don't startle her and it'll be just fine.

00:30:26.753 --> 00:30:28.620
- HUGO: What if she screams?

00:30:28.565 --> 00:30:30.192
- SOPHIA: Screaming not biting.

00:30:30.097 --> 00:30:31.995
Just say it to yourself: <i>"It can happen."</i>

00:30:31.916 --> 00:30:33.116
And that's all.

00:30:32.885 --> 00:30:34.245
- HUGO: I'll try.

00:30:34.452 --> 00:30:36.132
- AMICIA: See? It's easy.

00:30:36.423 --> 00:30:38.034
They don't all scream.

00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:39.058
- HUGO: Yes.

00:30:39.447 --> 00:30:40.447
She's nice.

00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:46.545
- SOPHIA: Alright! She's saved.
You've overcome your fear.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:48.894
And I want to see
that sanctuary. Let's go?

00:30:48.752 --> 00:30:50.561
- HUGO: Yes. Go!

00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:52.579
Your dad's waiting for you.

00:30:53.446 --> 00:30:54.806
She's not moving.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.814
- SOPHIA: She will. She's her own master.

00:31:16.116 --> 00:31:18.306
- SOLDIER: Thank you for your offerings.

00:31:17.989 --> 00:31:19.722
I'm sorry to push you out.

00:31:19.766 --> 00:31:21.966
But the ceremony will begin soon.

00:31:22.014 --> 00:31:23.694
- SOPHIA: Hmm... Soldier.

00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:25.425
- WOMAN 1: Oh, no problem.

00:31:25.504 --> 00:31:27.370
Make sure no trouble arises.

00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:30.639
- WOMAN 2: Yes... We had enough violence yesterday.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.476
- SOLDIER: We'll be especially careful.
Don't worry.

00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:38.375
- AMICIA: Well, thank you, Arnaud!

00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:40.356
- SOPHIA: That was to be expected.

00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:49.281
- AMICIA: Climb up.

00:31:53.172 --> 00:31:54.172
Up we go.

00:31:59.306 --> 00:32:01.106
Careful with the drop here.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.030
- HUGO: Alright.

00:32:04.218 --> 00:32:06.567
- SOLDIER 1: What do we do
with the last offerings?

00:32:06.377 --> 00:32:10.250
- SOLDIER 2: Let's stay here for now.
We'll bring it up there after the ceremony.

00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:09.076
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Careful.

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.928
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS) Looks like
they all really like their privacy here.

00:32:14.304 --> 00:32:16.519
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
How will we cross that gate?

00:32:16.313 --> 00:32:18.513
There's no way I can attack them.

00:32:18.427 --> 00:32:20.539
We'll get jailed, or worse.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.027
- HUGO: Oh... It's very high...

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:21.529
- SOPHIA: Oh... Wow...

00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:24.643
- AMICIA: Stick to the wall. Keep going.

00:35:25.072 --> 00:35:26.806
- HUGO: It makes me dizzy.

00:35:28.036 --> 00:35:29.036
Oh NO!

00:35:28.353 --> 00:35:29.473
- SOPHIA: Hey!

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.030
- AMICIA: Hugo!

00:35:30.918 --> 00:35:32.985
- SOPHIA: Oh shit! Bloody hell!

00:35:39.334 --> 00:35:41.381
- SOPHIA: I don't like your stunts, kid.

00:35:42.289 --> 00:35:43.969
- HUGO: I want to go...

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:46.241
- AMICIA: Yes... Let's keep moving.

00:35:47.533 --> 00:35:49.213
We're here. We made it.

00:35:49.986 --> 00:35:51.666
You're alright, Hugo?

00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:54.394
I'm sorry. I was... way too risky.

00:35:54.442 --> 00:35:56.122
- HUGO: I'm better now.

00:35:56.047 --> 00:35:57.914
- AMICIA: Thank you, Sophia!

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.680
- SOPHIA: It's nothing. It's just...

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.710
...my worst nightmare.

00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:04.562
- AMICIA: We should walk a bit...
On solid ground.

00:45:38.756 --> 00:45:40.823
- VICTOR: Friends and children.

00:45:41.584 --> 00:45:44.251
Today marks the longest day of the year.

00:45:45.234 --> 00:45:49.400
The light of the ... ...
shines upon us once again.

00:45:49.864 --> 00:45:51.464
- EMILIE: And yet...

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.596
In these cold hallways...

00:45:53.742 --> 00:45:55.342
Hidden from the sun.

00:45:55.821 --> 00:45:58.691
But <i>Child of Embers</i> still slumbers.

00:45:59.594 --> 00:46:02.728
- VICTOR: It is time
to bring the flame of the phoenix.

00:46:02.636 --> 00:46:03.998
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) The phoenix.

00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:05.109
- VICTOR: To his ...

00:46:04.276 --> 00:46:06.054
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
That's your bird.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.654
- EMILIE: Thus we will prove
that we deserve to care for him.

00:46:10.329 --> 00:46:11.329
Like Mother.

00:46:11.823 --> 00:46:13.503
- VICTOR: Like Father.

00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:19.869
- EMILIE: Let us pray together,
before we enter.

00:46:21.693 --> 00:46:23.426
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Come.

00:46:33.438 --> 00:46:34.878
What do you think?

00:46:35.538 --> 00:46:37.604
- SOPHIA: Bold, but believable.

00:46:37.879 --> 00:46:39.679
- HUGO: Are we dressing up?

00:47:10.588 --> 00:47:12.921
- VICTOR: Open your mind and heart.

00:47:12.975 --> 00:47:15.407
It is now time to tell his tale.

00:47:15.515 --> 00:47:17.868
- EMILIE: So that it is never forgotten.

00:47:17.657 --> 00:47:19.376
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
What do we do?

00:47:19.076 --> 00:47:21.113
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Let's follow them on our turn.

00:47:20.928 --> 00:47:22.448
And do as they say.

00:47:22.347 --> 00:47:24.081
They mustn't recognise us.

00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:25.289
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Yes.

00:47:24.527 --> 00:47:25.967
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Come on.

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:35.267
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) Wow.

00:47:36.021 --> 00:47:37.701
Amicia, look up there!

00:47:37.904 --> 00:47:39.621
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
The symbol of the Order.

00:47:39.807 --> 00:47:41.734
This place belongs to them.

00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:43.495
- VICTOR: Centuries ago...

00:47:43.697 --> 00:47:46.196
A child was born on this land.

00:47:46.804 --> 00:47:49.268
His heart was blessed by the sun.

00:47:49.876 --> 00:47:53.460
From which he inherited the flame
that rules everything.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.133
And so was born the <i>Child of Fire</i>.

00:47:57.186 --> 00:47:58.282
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) What?

00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:00.526
- EMILIE: His flame shone over the world.

00:48:00.619 --> 00:48:02.685
He blessed it with his perfume.

00:48:02.751 --> 00:48:04.633
His laughter, his joy.

00:48:04.699 --> 00:48:07.599
- VICTOR: Of all places,
La Cuna was his home.

00:48:08.229 --> 00:48:10.832
It become a land of life and peace.

00:48:11.216 --> 00:48:12.750
A place to heal.

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:14.310
To thrive.

00:48:14.478 --> 00:48:17.030
La Cuna became a cradle of light.

00:48:17.271 --> 00:48:19.741
- EMILIE: But light tames evil...

00:48:19.623 --> 00:48:22.721
- VICTOR: And evil knows no mercy.

00:48:22.748 --> 00:48:23.948
- EMILIE: Come.

00:48:25.715 --> 00:48:27.817
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
A child on a throne.

00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:29.339
In an Order's temple.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.332
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
It's him. The <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:48:34.435 --> 00:48:36.968
- EMILIE: Take your place at our side.

00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:40.176
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
Look! The drawing.

00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:42.147
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
It's the Carrier of the Macula.

00:48:42.028 --> 00:48:45.036
That fresco was in Mother's laboratory at home.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.530
- VICTOR: Please kneel.

00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:52.046
Evil found the child inside these very halls.

00:48:52.058 --> 00:48:53.766
It fed on his fire.

00:48:53.812 --> 00:48:54.812
Weakened it.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:57.992
Marked his flesh with cold black scars.

00:48:58.046 --> 00:49:00.946
His mother's arms couldn't warm him anymore.

00:49:00.817 --> 00:49:03.205
- EMILIE: And so his light faded.

00:49:03.312 --> 00:49:04.592
Almost entirely.

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:10.176
And the <i>Child of Fire</i> turned
into the <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:49:10.255 --> 00:49:11.658
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Lord...

00:49:11.216 --> 00:49:13.016
- EMILIE: A dark era began.

00:49:13.201 --> 00:49:15.877
Men forgot about him.
But we did not.

00:49:16.422 --> 00:49:20.696
This flame is the last gleam of his light.

00:49:21.264 --> 00:49:22.264
Our hope.

00:49:22.678 --> 00:49:24.278
And now, two of you.

00:49:24.459 --> 00:49:26.059
A woman and a child...

00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:28.591
...will carry it through his night.

00:49:32.685 --> 00:49:33.685
You.

00:49:34.227 --> 00:49:35.742
Your heads are bend.

00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:37.622
Your humility honoures you.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.793
You will walk his flame,
through his darkest ales.

00:49:41.824 --> 00:49:42.824
Take it.

00:49:48.062 --> 00:49:49.862
You will walk in his steps.

00:49:50.413 --> 00:49:52.960
Note the cold that bites the flesh.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.946
The drowning in the absence of light.

00:49:56.204 --> 00:49:57.484
The uncertainty.

00:49:57.331 --> 00:50:01.043
You will see the child died
through the eyes of his mother.

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:04.342
You will be the victim and the witness.

00:50:04.445 --> 00:50:06.595
Keep that torch alive.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.994
At all costs.

00:50:08.017 --> 00:50:11.747
- VICTOR: The Carrier has been chosen.
Take your places.

00:50:12.356 --> 00:50:13.947
- HUGO: (WHISPERS) What do we do?

00:50:13.755 --> 00:50:15.531
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
We have to play along.

00:50:15.192 --> 00:50:16.639
Let's... cross.

00:50:19.229 --> 00:50:22.096
- EMILIE: Go forth and bring him the light.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.640
Much depends on it.

00:50:31.159 --> 00:50:32.839
- AMICIA: This is unreal!

00:50:31.534 --> 00:50:33.214
- HUGO: Ah... It's cold.

00:50:32.641 --> 00:50:34.374
- AMICIA: Those frescos...

00:50:34.176 --> 00:50:35.216
The plague...

00:50:36.104 --> 00:50:38.697
They think it was caused by the child's death.

00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:40.774
So they don't have the Macula...

00:50:40.825 --> 00:50:42.625
- AMICIA: I don't think so.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.253
They interpreted all this.

00:50:44.878 --> 00:50:46.318
They made him God.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.560
Out of the Carrier of the Macula.

00:50:48.439 --> 00:50:51.511
- HUGO: Amicia, the water
will put out the torch.

00:50:51.746 --> 00:50:54.365
- AMICIA: I think... it's part of their ritual.

00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:56.745
<i>"Drowning in the absence of light."</i>

00:50:59.678 --> 00:51:01.278
- HUGO: I'm... cold.

00:51:01.511 --> 00:51:04.178
- AMICIA: It's over, we'll soon warm up.

00:51:03.949 --> 00:51:05.544
- HUGO: (COUGHS)

00:51:06.108 --> 00:51:07.785
It was horrible!

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.670
- AMICIA: But you did it.

00:51:09.521 --> 00:51:11.655
- HUGO: I though I was drowning.

00:51:11.812 --> 00:51:14.212
- AMICIA: Calm down.
You're fine now.

00:51:14.716 --> 00:51:16.396
- HUGO: No, I'm scared!

00:51:18.311 --> 00:51:19.311
(GASPS)

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.968
- AMICIA: Just walk. I'm with you.

00:51:37.987 --> 00:51:40.390
- VICTOR: You are back and the torch's gone.

00:51:40.436 --> 00:51:42.326
You are not alone anymore.

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:47.067
- EMILIE: His embers glow in the dark.

00:51:47.675 --> 00:51:50.147
I am the Mother and I welcome him.

00:51:50.821 --> 00:51:51.941
Pass it to me.

00:51:53.754 --> 00:51:54.794
You did well.

00:51:58.759 --> 00:51:59.959
Hear me, child.

00:52:00.638 --> 00:52:04.923
I am not ... anymore for your flame lives in me.

00:52:05.231 --> 00:52:06.511
I am the Mother.

00:52:07.114 --> 00:52:08.973
Become the phoenix.

00:52:09.053 --> 00:52:11.895
The <i>Child of Fire</i> reborn.

00:52:12.898 --> 00:52:15.955
- VICTOR: Join us. Blow on these flames.

00:52:15.989 --> 00:52:17.349
- AMICIA: (GASPS)

00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:22.339
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
The phoenix... It's the phoenix!

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.570
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS)
Shhh... Yes... I see it.

00:52:25.853 --> 00:52:30.013
- HUGO: (WHISPERS)
It's real... Even if it's the Order, it's all true.

00:52:35.537 --> 00:52:37.328
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Hey, it's me.

00:52:36.902 --> 00:52:38.046
- AMICIA: (WHISPERS) Sophia...

00:52:37.828 --> 00:52:40.265
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS)
Come, I found a passage back there.

00:52:40.209 --> 00:52:41.649
It's now or never.

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:45.417
- EMILIE: May the breeze of life
we ignite his flame.

00:53:43.506 --> 00:53:45.509
- AMICIA: This is unbelievable.

00:53:45.566 --> 00:53:47.246
- SOPHIA: No kidding.

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:10.245
- AMICIA: A child's throne.

00:54:10.043 --> 00:54:11.959
He... He lived here.

00:54:13.457 --> 00:54:15.590
- SOPHIA: Their <i>Child of Embers</i>?

00:54:17.369 --> 00:54:19.466
- AMICIA: There's no <i>Child of Embers</i>.

00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:21.119
I told you about the Order.

00:54:21.323 --> 00:54:23.190
This place belonged to them.

00:54:23.425 --> 00:54:26.233
And this child... on the frescos...

00:54:26.548 --> 00:54:29.014
It's the Carrier of the Prima Macula.

00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:31.525
- SOPHIA: The Prima Macula?

00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:34.049
This just gets better and better.

00:54:35.206 --> 00:54:38.406
- AMICIA: Alchemists call it the <i>First Corruption</i>.

00:54:38.748 --> 00:54:41.454
It awoken Hugo's blood when he's a baby.

00:54:42.611 --> 00:54:44.478
It keeps growing inside him.

00:54:45.945 --> 00:54:48.011
- SOPHIA: And it's killing him.

00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:54.201
- AMICIA: That was the whole place is about.

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.177
The advent of the Carrier of the Macula.

00:54:57.773 --> 00:55:00.913
The Order gathering around him, studying him.

00:55:00.971 --> 00:55:02.837
Trying to find the solution.

00:55:02.902 --> 00:55:03.831
And...

00:55:03.889 --> 00:55:04.889
Rats.

00:55:04.898 --> 00:55:06.098
Let me guess...

00:55:06.318 --> 00:55:09.284
Death... War... Disease... Or farmine...

00:55:10.532 --> 00:55:12.212
- AMICIA: Not only...

00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:13.718
The rats are...

00:55:15.654 --> 00:55:19.641
Anyway, they got it all wrong.
There's no <i>Child of Embers</i>...

00:55:19.891 --> 00:55:22.124
That would come and save the world.

00:55:21.898 --> 00:55:23.098
It's a fantasy.

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:25.403
They crafted to fit their hopes.

00:55:25.879 --> 00:55:29.207
- SOPHIA: All of it sound like
a crazy fantasy to me.

00:55:29.871 --> 00:55:31.804
- AMICIA: Part of it is true.

00:55:32.547 --> 00:55:34.347
The part that can save him.

00:55:35.586 --> 00:55:37.386
The only part that matters.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.320
<i>"Basilius and Aelia."</i>

00:55:48.123 --> 00:55:49.856
- HUGO: Nothing's changed.

00:55:51.218 --> 00:55:52.898
That water's not magic.

00:55:54.046 --> 00:55:55.646
- AMICIA: The water?

00:55:56.022 --> 00:55:58.199
Oh! From the healing pond.

00:55:58.210 --> 00:55:59.330
In your dream.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:02.770
It's like a symbol.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.539
Like Mother's... alchemic joints.

00:56:07.723 --> 00:56:10.958
- SOPHIA: Stagnating water is rarely magic.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.360
- AMICIA: Hey, come see.

00:56:16.451 --> 00:56:20.298
That's his throne.
And this, I think, is his name.

00:56:22.851 --> 00:56:24.291
- HUGO: <i>"Basil..."</i>

00:56:24.166 --> 00:56:26.536
- AMICIA: He was a Carrier just like you.

00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:27.989
You're not the only one.

00:56:28.041 --> 00:56:30.308
That's why you dreamt of all this.

00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:33.439
Something called you here,
and for good reason.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.397
I mean look at this place...

00:56:35.428 --> 00:56:37.894
If there's a cure, it has to be here.

00:56:38.331 --> 00:56:40.011
- HUGO: And who is Aelia?

00:56:40.485 --> 00:56:43.671
- SOPHIA: It looks like there's more
to this place, behind here.

00:56:45.612 --> 00:56:47.545
- AMICIA: Let's keep looking.

00:56:51.002 --> 00:56:54.330
Come, I'm sure there're
extraordinary things waiting.

00:56:54.684 --> 00:56:55.804
- HUGO: Hmm...

00:57:29.198 --> 00:57:30.706
- AMICIA: What's all this?

00:57:30.298 --> 00:57:32.781
- SOPHIA: Are we...
the first to come in here?

00:57:32.634 --> 00:57:34.154
- HUGO: Oh, a tent!

00:57:34.492 --> 00:57:35.818
- AMICIA: You're right.

00:57:35.843 --> 00:57:37.363
It looks untouched.

00:57:37.257 --> 00:57:39.724
- SOPHIA: Too sacred for them, maybe?

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.013
- AMICIA: What is it?

01:05:05.238 --> 01:05:09.569
- SOPHIA: Your alchemists wrote down
everything that happened to the Carrier.

01:05:09.396 --> 01:05:11.076
It's sorted by date.

01:05:11.358 --> 01:05:12.957
The last entry...

01:05:13.048 --> 01:05:16.166
...was in the year...
<i>five hundred and forty one</i>.

01:05:16.378 --> 01:05:18.418
- AMICIA: <i>Five hundred and forty one</i>...

01:05:18.525 --> 01:05:19.885
What does it say?

01:05:20.798 --> 01:05:24.021
- SOPHIA: I haven't studied Latin
since convern but...

01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:25.781
It talks about Basilius.

01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:28.981
And... er...

01:05:29.703 --> 01:05:30.703
Hmm...

01:05:30.955 --> 01:05:34.114
Aelias ..., his Protector.

01:05:34.705 --> 01:05:37.038
- AMICIA: It really did all happen.

01:05:37.317 --> 01:05:38.997
They were just like us.

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:41.290
- HUGO: What happened to them?

01:05:42.783 --> 01:05:45.901
- SOPHIA: <i>"The Order took away
the Carrier from her...</i>

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.223
<i>"She rebelled...</i>

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:52.444
<i>"And was arrested to...
close to... a round tower.</i>

01:05:52.752 --> 01:05:54.600
<i>"... to...</i>.

01:05:54.725 --> 01:05:56.176
Er... A capella...

01:05:56.199 --> 01:05:57.199
A-A chapel.

01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:58.361
Inside a fort.

01:05:58.452 --> 01:06:00.719
- HUGO: And Basilius, where is he?

01:06:02.176 --> 01:06:03.856
- SOPHIA: It doesn't say.

01:06:04.452 --> 01:06:06.794
- AMICIA: Well, we have something to go on.

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.382
A fort... A round tower.

01:06:08.689 --> 01:06:09.910
(DOOR OPENS)

01:06:13.138 --> 01:06:14.818
- HUGO: They're coming.

01:06:14.879 --> 01:06:16.828
- SOPHIA: We're lucky
they didn't come sooner.

01:06:16.727 --> 01:06:19.527
- AMICIA: Yes, let's get out of here fast.

01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:44.735
- SOPHIA: (WHISPERS) Through there.

01:09:39.227 --> 01:09:41.641
- SOPHIA: Spending a full week
at sea with my crew.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.893
Changes the notion of stench forever.

01:09:44.099 --> 01:09:46.299
- AMICIA: That was enough for me.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:49.097
Let's go to that fort.

01:09:50.238 --> 01:09:51.238
Hugo?

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:54.086
- HUGO: There was no fort in my dream.

01:09:54.972 --> 01:09:58.543
- AMICIA: Maybe... But your dream
put us in the right track.

01:10:01.054 --> 01:10:03.588
Now we just have to find out the rest.

01:10:04.584 --> 01:10:07.725
- SOPHIA: Don't you want to know
what happened to that Aelia?

01:10:07.759 --> 01:10:09.834
And your... <i>"ancestor"</i>?

01:10:16.265 --> 01:10:18.598
- AMICIA: It's going to be alright.

01:10:25.327 --> 01:10:29.215
- HUGO: Erm... Can we take
these stinky clothes off now?

01:10:30.055 --> 01:10:31.735
- AMICIA: Yes, we should.
