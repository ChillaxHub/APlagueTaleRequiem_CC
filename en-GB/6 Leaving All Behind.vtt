00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:37.839
VI - LEAVING ALL BEHIND

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.760
- HUGO: They don't know
how to pilot the boat.

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:56.573
- AMICIA: Hm?

00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:57.941
- HUGO: Mummy and Lucas.

00:00:58.526 --> 00:00:59.726
- AMICIA: Oh...

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:02.901
They're... alright, Hugo...

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.313
They're the smartest people I know.

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:08.206
- HUGO: It's bleeding again.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:12.776
- AMICIA: Yes, we should fix that
before it gets infected I guess.

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:14.792
- HUGO: There's water over there.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.990
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.920
Is it your island?

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:41.714
- HUGO: Yes.

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:43.722
These look like teeth.

00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:45.644
It's a two teeth island.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:47.838
- AMICIA: You know...

00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:49.078
I think I saw it...

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.400
On a painting...

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.910
In Vaudin's laboratory.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.299
- HUGO: So it's really real?

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.620
I'll do it.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.987
- AMICIA: Be gentle, please.

00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:02.386
- HUGO: Yes.

00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:09.464
It's done.

00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:11.058
- AMICIA: Already?

00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:13.011
Nice!

00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:14.308
Thank you!

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:16.392
You're good at this.

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:18.660
- HUGO: I tried not to hurt you.

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.901
- AMICIA: You're good at this.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:22.088
Now come on sir.

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:24.331
We need to find your island.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.980
- HUGO: Yes.

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:05.342
How do we get to an island?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.670
- AMICIA: By boat.

00:03:06.323 --> 00:03:08.003
Once we know where it is.

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:10.026
- HUGO: Do you think Mummy will be angry?

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:11.432
- AMICIA: She won't be pleased, but...

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.245
Don't worry.

00:05:03.823 --> 00:05:05.757
- HUGO: That was a good race.

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:06.783
- AMICIA: It... was.

00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:09.562
- HUGO: It's still hurting you?

00:05:09.026 --> 00:05:10.066
- AMICIA: No.

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:12.860
- AMICIA: What hurts the most is...

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:14.581
That I'm a chicken now!

00:05:14.683 --> 00:05:16.483
- HUGO: But a nice chicken!

00:05:16.073 --> 00:05:18.088
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES) You're too kind!

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.501
- HUGO: Next time, I'm letting you win.

00:05:19.808 --> 00:05:23.401
- AMICIA: Oh no!
Next time, I'll crush you! (CHUCKLES)

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:24.281
- HUGO: Oh... Do you hear that?

00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:25.901
What is it?

00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:27.355
- AMICIA: Chants.

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:29.206
It sounds like a mass.

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:31.042
- HUGO: There's a church here?

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.620
- AMICIA: We'll see.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.520
What is that?

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:34.293
- HUGO: A market!

00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:36.951
- AMICIA: No... We're too far from a city.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.337
But the chants are coming from there.

00:06:39.714 --> 00:06:41.808
- HUGO: Maybe they know about the island.

00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.506
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:44.515
We're going to ask.

00:07:15.276 --> 00:07:16.476
- WOMAN: Hello.

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:18.401
Can I... do something for you?

00:07:18.511 --> 00:07:22.095
- AMICIA: Hello... Yes...
We're trying to find our way...

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.604
- HUGO: Why are people singing?

00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:26.213
- WOMAN: Oh... Because it's mass time.

00:07:26.276 --> 00:07:27.796
We run a pilgrimige.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.530
So we pray for the success of our journey.

00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:32.932
- AMICIA: Oh... you're on your way to Rome?

00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:33.965
- WOMAN: Exactly.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.312
And you? Where are you heading?

00:07:36.464 --> 00:07:38.144
- AMICIA: To an island.

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:39.999
We... don't know much about it.

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:43.198
- WOMAN: Hm... Our leader Parrow,
he knows the region well.

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:44.386
He will help you.

00:07:44.167 --> 00:07:46.234
You'll find him near the ruins.

00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:47.854
He's the one leading the mass.

00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:50.500
Though you should rest a while in the shade.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.995
You look hurt.

00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:53.626
- AMICIA: Ah... yes.

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:54.542
Thank you!

00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:55.841
- HUGO: Thank you!

00:07:55.448 --> 00:07:57.128
- WOMAN: You're welcome!

00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:14.057
- HUGO: Why are they going to Rome?

00:08:13.714 --> 00:08:15.838
- AMICIA: Because next year is ...

00:08:15.683 --> 00:08:17.363
It's a very special year.

00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:19.636
Let's try to find that Parrow.

00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:25.167
(CHILDREN LAUGHTERS)

00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:26.894
- MAN: Careful, children!

00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:28.245
Not too fast.

00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:31.799
- HUGO: Hi goose! (CHUCKLES)

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:32.956
(GOOSE SAYS "HI" BACK)

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.619
- MAN 1: Well, we seem to be doing alright.

00:08:33.854 --> 00:08:34.894
- MAN 2: Yes.

00:08:53.104 --> 00:08:54.304
- WOMAN: Hello.

00:08:54.214 --> 00:08:55.894
- AMICIA: Oh... Hello.

00:08:55.511 --> 00:08:56.631
- HUGO: Hello.

00:09:02.526 --> 00:09:04.326
- AMICIA: There's our mass.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.854
- HUGO: Isn't that Parrow at the back?

00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:06.584
- MAN: Shhh...

00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:07.495
Yes.

00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:09.573
You'll see him after it's finished

00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:11.354
- HUGO: Oh... Sorry.

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.495
- AMICIA: We'll wait here. Thank you!

00:09:31.245 --> 00:09:32.285
- HUGO: Amen.

00:09:31.964 --> 00:09:32.964
- MAN: Huh?

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.088
- AMICIA: <i>"Amen"</i> doesn't mean <i>"thank you"</i>, you know.

00:09:34.854 --> 00:09:35.894
- HUGO: Ah...

00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:37.213
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES) Let's talk to him.

00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:43.662
- HUGO: Hello.

00:09:44.854 --> 00:09:46.534
- PERREUX: Oh... Hello.

00:09:46.808 --> 00:09:47.808
And welcome.

00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:49.431
You're new here.

00:09:49.448 --> 00:09:52.448
- AMICIA: Yes... Well, actually we're a bit lost.

00:09:52.683 --> 00:09:54.385
- PERREUX: And where are you going?

00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:56.382
Not to Rome, I would've seen.

00:09:56.308 --> 00:09:58.823
- HUGO: No... We're looking for an island.

00:09:58.558 --> 00:10:01.682
It has two teeth, and there's a bird, and a small lake.

00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:02.838
And flowers...

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:06.651
- AMICIA: It's probably an island
with two large moutains.

00:10:06.761 --> 00:10:08.901
We were told you could help us find it.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:10.807
- PERREUX: Not from memory.

00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:14.613
But I have an old map
of the Mediterranean Sea some where.

00:10:14.917 --> 00:10:16.151
Do you want to have a look.

00:10:16.245 --> 00:10:18.995
- AMICIA: Yes, thank you. That'd be perfect.

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:20.488
- SOLDIER: Good people.

00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:25.104
- PERREUX: What's going on?

00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:27.088
- SOLDIER: We're looking for a boy and a girl.

00:10:26.651 --> 00:10:28.963
The girl has killed several soldiers.

00:10:28.683 --> 00:10:30.416
She's armed and dangerous.

00:10:30.433 --> 00:10:32.699
By order of Count Victor of Arles.

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.510
We're searching this camp.

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:37.401
- PERREUX: I know a guilty look when I see one.

00:10:37.448 --> 00:10:39.495
But... whatever you've done.

00:10:40.464 --> 00:10:42.197
I won't give up the child.

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:45.832
Come with me.

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:57.000
We need to get you out of the camp.

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:58.326
Follow me closely.

00:10:58.729 --> 00:11:00.009
Try to blend in.

00:10:59.729 --> 00:11:01.409
- WOMAN 1: What's going on?

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:03.306
- SOLDIER: Make way. Clear your tents.

00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:05.385
- WOMAN 2: They're looking for someone.

00:11:04.558 --> 00:11:07.566
- SOLDIER: Cooperate, and no harm will be done.

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:09.288
- MAN 1: Please, don't hurt us.

00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:11.481
- MAN 2: We haven't done anything.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:12.338
We're good Christians.

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:14.687
- PERREUX: Careful.

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:35.166
- SOLDIER 1: Two children.
A girl and a small boy.

00:11:35.292 --> 00:11:38.291
- MAN: I'm not sure.
There-there're so many of us now.

00:11:37.729 --> 00:11:39.409
- SOLDIER 1: Then, think.

00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:41.620
- WOMAN: Hey! Be careful!

00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:43.363
- SOLDIER 2: Stay back!

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:46.756
- PERREUX: No.

00:11:46.151 --> 00:11:47.591
- AMICIA: Problem.

00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:49.338
- PERREUX: Hide under that cart
before they see you.

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:50.746
I'll handle them.

00:12:20.136 --> 00:12:22.402
- PERREUX: The way is clear. Come.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.562
- AMICIA: Let's go.

00:12:26.464 --> 00:12:28.338
- PERREUX: You'll find a path to the sea.

00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:29.835
On the other side of this ...

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.401
- AMICIA: We won't forget this.

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:32.263
- HUGO: Thank you!

00:12:31.854 --> 00:12:33.534
- PERREUX: Be careful.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.182
- AMICIA: Come on.
We need to get away from here.

00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:38.901
- HUGO: I hope this all just won't happen.

00:12:38.776 --> 00:12:41.088
- AMICIA: They won't hurt anybody
if they don't find us.

00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:43.215
Let's get as far away as possible.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.166
- SOLDIER: Some people just saw a boy
and a girl crossing the camp.

00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:52.916
Extend the search!

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.256
- HUGO: Oh no!

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.353
- AMICIA: Quick!

00:12:57.901 --> 00:12:59.581
Run, Hugo! Straight on!

00:13:02.675 --> 00:13:04.491
- AMICIA: Take... your hands...

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.034
...off me!

00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:08.553
Oh no! Hugo!

00:13:14.237 --> 00:13:15.437
- HUGO: Amicia!

00:13:14.823 --> 00:13:17.108
- AMICIA: (GROANS) My head.

00:13:16.073 --> 00:13:18.397
- HUGO: Get up! We must leave!

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.467
- AMICIA: Yes... Yes...

00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:22.791
I'm dizzy.

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:24.437
Your hand.

00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:27.331
- HUGO: You're bleeding again.

00:13:27.597 --> 00:13:28.957
- AMICIA: Lord...

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.104
- SOLDIER: After them!

00:13:32.128 --> 00:13:33.328
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:37.459
We must leave!

00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:39.615
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:42.342
We have to keep... moving.

00:13:44.022 --> 00:13:45.487
- HUGO: Where are we?

00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:47.479
- AMICIA: Looks like... a quarry.

00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:51.131
- HUGO: We're going in there? It's dark.

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:55.897
- AMICIA: I don't...
know if there's another way.

00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:00.116
Let's push inside.

00:14:00.253 --> 00:14:02.948
We must not stay in the open.

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:11.346
We'll make it.
Now we know where the sea is.

00:14:11.444 --> 00:14:14.217
- HUGO: It doesn't matter.
I want you to be safe.

00:14:14.003 --> 00:14:15.123
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:14:15.214 --> 00:14:17.791
I'm... working on it.

00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:31.659
- HUGO: Where are they?

00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:34.725
- AMICIA: Don't know. Hold my hand tight.

00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:36.483
- HUGO: Did you really kill soldiers?

00:14:36.054 --> 00:14:38.807
- AMICIA: Yes... I-I-I lost myself.

00:14:38.866 --> 00:14:40.666
- HUGO: You didn't tell me!

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.070
- AMICIA: I was ashamed.

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:43.514
Now stay focused.

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:46.464
Take care of it, Hugo.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.190
- HUGO: Yes.

00:38:14.995 --> 00:38:16.195
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:38:16.597 --> 00:38:18.100
Are you alright?

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.631
- AMICIA: I'm fine... I'm fine...

00:38:24.409 --> 00:38:25.409
Let's go.

00:38:35.073 --> 00:38:36.273
- HUGO: Amicia?

00:38:36.616 --> 00:38:37.616
Amicia!

00:38:38.198 --> 00:38:39.198
No!

00:38:39.741 --> 00:38:41.341
It's bleeding a lot.

00:38:43.003 --> 00:38:45.003
- SOLDIER: Look, they're here.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.870
- HUGO: They're coming!

00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:50.129
- AMICIA: I can't. You have to handle it yourself.

00:38:50.015 --> 00:38:51.695
- HUGO: Are you sure?

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.295
- AMICIA: Do it. Quick!

00:39:44.702 --> 00:39:47.885
- AMICIA: Stop, Hugo! You're losing control!

00:39:48.022 --> 00:39:51.069
- HUGO: (PANTING)

00:39:51.147 --> 00:39:52.827
- AMICIA: Hugo? Hugo!

00:39:52.866 --> 00:39:54.916
What's wrong? What's wrong?

00:40:10.757 --> 00:40:13.803
(PANTING)

00:40:13.842 --> 00:40:16.401
Oh Lord... Lord...

00:40:16.479 --> 00:40:19.213
(PANTING)

00:40:19.311 --> 00:40:21.111
We have to get out of here.

00:40:22.944 --> 00:40:24.174
- HUGO: What?

00:40:24.546 --> 00:40:26.205
What was that noise?

00:40:27.417 --> 00:40:28.881
- AMICIA: Oh no!

00:40:30.425 --> 00:40:32.105
I'll get us out of here.

00:40:34.018 --> 00:40:36.381
- HUGO: I... I did it again?

00:40:37.593 --> 00:40:40.307
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

00:40:41.206 --> 00:40:43.471
- AMICIA: I... am gonna make it.

00:40:59.253 --> 00:41:00.933
- HUGO: Amicia, come!

00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:03.549
- AMICIA: I can't, I can't.

00:41:02.456 --> 00:41:03.656
- HUGO: Please!

00:41:03.725 --> 00:41:05.444
- HUGO: Amicia, quick!

00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:06.921
- AMICIA: I can't.

00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:07.553
- HUGO: Amicia!

00:41:07.651 --> 00:41:09.057
Please come!

Amicia!
