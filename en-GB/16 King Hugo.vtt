00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:51.790
XVI - KING HUGO

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.701
- LUCAS: I thought you were unstoppable.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.201
- AMICIA: I'm not.

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.145
I just forget it sometimes.

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:10.045
Lucas.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.519
I must say...

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:18.910
It's an honour to have you by my side.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:25.070
You're... the most reliable... steady...

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:28.016
...nice thing in the world.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.095
- LUCAS: I don't know.
(CHUCKLES)

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.140
But... ah...

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:36.559
You're my family.

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:40.708
- SOPHIA: You're sharing all this
because you think you won't make it?

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.943
You also have a lot to live.
So you'll make it.

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:46.714
This is a damn order.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.606
- AMICIA: He must live.

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.984
He deserves so much better than this.

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:13.221
- SOPHIA: Now, just watch your step.

00:02:37.217 --> 00:02:38.497
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:42.004
They really look like an army.

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:43.266
- LUCAS: They are.

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:45.518
Now that Hugo's become their leader.

00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:48.290
- AMICIA: It was always
his favourite game - conquering.

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:50.673
- SOPHIA: Wow... Someone's dream came true.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.754
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:17.338
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:22.545
- LUCAS: Look who survived.

00:03:25.013 --> 00:03:26.693
- AMICIA: A carnation.

00:03:27.843 --> 00:03:30.376
It's the first flower Hugo offered me.

00:03:30.936 --> 00:03:33.161
Just before we met you, Lucas.

00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:36.273
- LUCAS: Makes me feel old.

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:39.075
- SOPHIA: That flower is sure
to put a smile on his face.

00:03:38.587 --> 00:03:39.707
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:04:03.374 --> 00:04:05.352
Did... he do this?

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:08.797
- LUCAS: He's one with the Macula now.

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:11.027
- SOPHIA: So we're really going <i>in there</i>?

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:14.078
- AMICIA: I'm sorry.

00:04:14.523 --> 00:04:16.203
- SOPHIA: That's alright.

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:18.551
I've had enough fun, I guess.

00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:21.140
And my boat is wrecked anyway.

00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:23.563
Just tell me we can stop this.

00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:26.985
- LUCAS: If we can get to him, maybe...

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:29.635
But it'll be a deep dive.

00:04:30.044 --> 00:04:31.777
- AMICIA: Listen, I'll go.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.319
I'm the one who...

00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:33.625
- LUCAS: Amicia!

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:37.169
We need whatever
connects him to this world.

00:04:37.613 --> 00:04:39.293
We're all tied to him.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.460
So...

00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:49.276
- AMICIA: So let's dive.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.425
(MUSIC INTENSIFIES)

00:04:58.775 --> 00:04:59.775
Hugo...

00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:01.561
Grab something!

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.620
- SOPHIA: I'm alive!

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:22.435
You're alive?

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:34.373
Ah... (GROANS)

00:05:34.507 --> 00:05:36.187
- AMICIA: Is it broken?

00:05:35.693 --> 00:05:37.315
- SOPHIA: (GROANS)

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.887
No... no. No.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.578
It's just... (GROANS)

00:05:42.656 --> 00:05:44.336
- LUCAS: Are you alright?

00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:46.528
- AMICIA: Sophia's hurt.

00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:49.787
- SOPHIA: (GROANS)

00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:50.010
- LUCAS: I'm trying to join you.

00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:51.543
- AMICIA: Don't move.

00:05:57.743 --> 00:06:01.316
- SOPHIA: I told you!
I'm not made... for land.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.856
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:05.689
Not for landing.
That's for sure.

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:15.166
- SOPHIA: Sorry.

00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:17.192
- AMICIA: Don't be.

00:06:17.636 --> 00:06:19.570
You've done more than enough.

00:06:20.243 --> 00:06:21.923
Lucas and I, we've...

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.299
...been through this before...

00:06:25.122 --> 00:06:26.122
Sort of...

00:06:28.444 --> 00:06:31.344
- SOPHIA: Not all legends need sailors, huh?

00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:33.157
That's sad.

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:38.299
Go...

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:40.566
...and come back with him.

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:46.044
- AMICIA: I'll see you under the sun.

00:06:55.646 --> 00:06:58.423
Keep going, Hugo's close.

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:00.997
Need to find Lucas first.

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:11.090
- SOPHIA: I'm not going anywhere, Amicia.

00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:12.439
- AMICIA: We'll come back for you.

00:07:11.884 --> 00:07:14.350
- SOPHIA: I know.
Go go.

00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:22.430
- AMICIA: Is that really... you?

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.152
- LUCAS: Amicia, I'm here!

00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:26.028
- AMICIA: Hey!

00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:27.181
- LUCAS: And Sophia?

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.790
- AMICIA: She can't walk.
It's only the two of us now.

00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:31.249
- LUCAS: We can still do this.

00:07:30.996 --> 00:07:33.582
You see that piece of wall standing below?

00:07:33.303 --> 00:07:35.236
The rats are going around it.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:36.531
Let's meet there.

00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:39.068
- AMICIA: Yes... But wait... Wait!

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:40.753
One mistake and...

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:43.012
- LUCAS: I know, but I've been counting...

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:45.319
And they keep the exact same pacing.

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:47.621
We can make it between two waves.

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:50.632
- AMICIA: Alright... alright... Alright!

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.438
- LUCAS: Ready when you are.

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.572
Don't worry, I'll keep up with you.

00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:05.211
- AMICIA: Now!

00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:06.691
- LUCAS: Oh goodness!

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:08.766
- AMICIA: Run run RUN!

00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:10.407
- LUCAS: Ahhhhhhh!!!!

00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:14.021
- AMICIA: It works!

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:15.873
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:17.704
Let's keep... running to...

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.790
- AMICIA: Now!

00:08:17.838 --> 00:08:18.878
- LUCAS: Yes!

00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:20.653
Ah! Bastards!

00:08:23.678 --> 00:08:25.118
- AMICIA: Perfect!

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.278
- LUCAS: I'm here.

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:30.109
- AMICIA: Let's go!

00:08:30.517 --> 00:08:31.930
Woah... Careful!

00:08:32.737 --> 00:08:34.417
That gate looks stuck!

00:08:37.246 --> 00:08:38.846
- LUCAS: Wait, WAIT!

00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:42.481
- AMICIA: Are you ready?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.100
- LUCAS: (PANTING) I think so.

00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:48.740
- AMICIA: They're coming! Come on! Do it!

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:54.019
- LUCAS: There you go!

00:08:54.912 --> 00:08:55.952
- AMICIA: Now!

00:08:56.583 --> 00:08:57.668
No no NO!

00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:59.790
- LUCAS: Ah! Bloody hell!

00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:02.311
- AMICIA: Please hold!

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:04.838
No no... Don't stay there!

00:09:07.168 --> 00:09:08.168
Move MOVE!

00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.781
- LUCAS: With you!

00:09:14.713 --> 00:09:16.129
This is madness!

00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:20.029
- AMICIA: Lucas, the roof!

00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:21.636
- LUCAS: I see it!

00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:25.436
Oh...

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:27.023
My heart...

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.743
- AMICIA: It will hold. Move it!

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.599
- LUCAS: Right!

00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:36.485
- AMICIA: There!

00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:42.588
- LUCAS: Move! Please move!

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:45.498
- AMICIA: These walls have to hold.

00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:51.044
Come on, Lucas!

00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:52.003
- LUCAS: I'm with you!

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.284
No!

00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:55.541
- AMICIA: The bridge! Quick!

00:09:55.776 --> 00:09:57.776
- LUCAS: Ah! We won't make it!

00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.771
- AMICIA: We can! RUN!

00:10:00.736 --> 00:10:01.776
- LUCAS: Yes!

00:10:02.576 --> 00:10:03.576
Yes...

00:10:04.325 --> 00:10:06.881
- AMICIA: (PANTING)

00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:08.388
We're here... (PANTING)

00:10:08.415 --> 00:10:10.212
I think... (PANTING)

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:12.731
We're safe... (PANTING)

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.105
- LUCAS: For how long?

00:10:15.184 --> 00:10:17.051
- AMICIA: He's there, Lucas.

00:10:17.964 --> 00:10:19.084
He's in reach.

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.129
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.830
- AMICIA: Look at you...

00:10:42.027 --> 00:10:43.707
Hiding under a blanket.

00:10:44.064 --> 00:10:45.797
Just like when you're sad.

00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:52.066
- LUCAS: The Nebula's
condensing around him.

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:54.726
So much must be going on in there.

00:10:56.501 --> 00:10:59.167
- AMICIA: What should we expect to find?

00:11:00.116 --> 00:11:01.796
- LUCAS: Hard to tell.

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.323
Think of it as a giant crucible where the...

00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:08.291
...the Macula, Hugo, and the Nebula are merging.

00:11:09.094 --> 00:11:11.294
The visions of the deceived child.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.204
Dissolving into the atmosphere.

00:11:15.135 --> 00:11:16.655
Changing the world.

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:23.346
This is the last threshold.

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:25.932
All natural laws stop here.

00:11:28.282 --> 00:11:30.549
- AMICIA: So we must cross it too?

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:33.357
- LUCAS: To reach your brother, yes.

00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:39.859
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.723
Take a deep breath.

00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:05.218
(COUGHS)

00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:39.731
(GASPS)

00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:43.715
(COUGHS)

00:12:44.035 --> 00:12:45.035
Lucas?

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:49.796
Lucas?

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.110
Lucas? (COUGHS) Lord...

00:13:00.422 --> 00:13:02.675
Lucas, where are you?

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.195
(COUGHS)

00:13:06.991 --> 00:13:08.440
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:13:08.464 --> 00:13:09.464
My head...

00:13:09.717 --> 00:13:10.997
It's spinning...

00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:16.299
Focus!

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:17.499
Hugo first!

00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:19.006
Find him!

00:13:30.148 --> 00:13:31.601
Hugo, it's me!

00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:32.681
I'm alive!

00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:33.761
I'm back!

00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:36.704
Where are you?

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.576
What's that? No!

00:13:42.236 --> 00:13:43.236
Can't be!

00:13:45.027 --> 00:13:46.027
A phoenix?

00:13:46.506 --> 00:13:47.506
Here?

00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:02.713
Another one?

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:04.299
What's going on?

00:14:04.326 --> 00:14:05.606
What's going on?

00:14:05.526 --> 00:14:07.046
What is this place?

00:14:12.366 --> 00:14:14.900
The phoenixes...
They meant something.

00:14:17.126 --> 00:14:18.566
They show the way!

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:20.949
They must lead to him!

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:24.493
(CHUCKLES) am I losing my mind?

00:14:27.192 --> 00:14:28.192
Hugo!

00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:30.131
Are you doing this?

00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:33.947
<i>"All natural laws stop here."</i>

00:14:34.787 --> 00:14:36.990
Right... Hang on to that.

00:14:44.368 --> 00:14:46.795
Did you... put them here Hugo?

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:48.354
- HUGO: <i>No.</i>

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:49.919
<i>You did.</i>
