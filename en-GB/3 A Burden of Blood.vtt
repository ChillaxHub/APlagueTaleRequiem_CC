00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:36.281
III - A BURDEN OF BLOOD

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:41.430
- AMICIA:
(FRUSTRATINGLY EXHALES)

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:44.255
- BÉATRICE: Lucas.
Come, right now.

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:45.233
- LUCAS: Coming!

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:47.382
- AMICIA: I heard Hugo crying.
What's going on?

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:49.814
- BÉATRICE: He didn't react well.
He's having a seizure.

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:50.352
- AMICIA: What? Mother!

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:51.781
You must stop this!

00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:53.508
We don't know this man!

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.515
- BÉATRICE: Amicia!
This sort of thing was always likely.

00:00:55.578 --> 00:01:00.781
And <i>this man</i> is an exalted member
of <i>the</i> most ancient college of alchemists that exists.

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:02.859
The Order <i>knows</i> the Macula.

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:05.515
Hugo's not alone.
I'm here.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.571
We need nightshade
as soon as possible to calm the tremors.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:13.609
There is a herbalist
in the outskirt of the city.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:17.437
It's at the other end of the butcher's district
at the edge of the forest.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.469
You'll see.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.629
- LUCAS: Of course.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.187
- AMICIA: I'm coming.

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:22.203
I feel useless here anyway.

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.812
(RAIN SOUND)

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.315
(DOOR SHUTS HEAVILY)

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:46.890
(RAIN SOUND)

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.489
- LUCAS: Foul rain!

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.321
We have a long way to go.

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:52.133
Let's not waste time.

00:01:52.203 --> 00:02:17.734
(RAIN SOUND)

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:20.744
- AMICIA: Things are getting
worse and worse.

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:21.234
- LUCAS: I know you're worried.

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:24.241
But you should give
Magister Vaudin some time.

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:25.014
- AMICIA: Time??

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:25.625
To do <i>what</i>??

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:27.499
Make Hugo feel even worse?

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.312
- LUCAS: He's conducting tests.

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:31.024
He knows what he's doing.

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:33.236
He's the most competent in his domain.

00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:36.875
- AMICIA: Urghh... Enough of that!
He's been treating my brother like an animal!

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.219
No!

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:39.414
We need another solution.

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:40.844
Like...

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.878
This island Hugo dreams of.

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:44.614
- LUCAS: A dream...

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.775
What can we do with a dream, Amicia?

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.829
- AMICIA: Just...

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.450
...keep caring about him, please!

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:51.827
- LUCAS: I care!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.164
But it's not enough anymore.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:03:04.187
(RAIN SOUND)

00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:06.113
- AMICIA: Everybody's gone.

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:25.968
(RAIN SOUND)

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.474
- LUCAS: I think it's through here.

00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:32.307
- MAN: I can't believe
they've blocked the way to the arena.

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.494
- WOMAN: What's happened down there?

00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.968
- LUCAS: Alright.
Our gate should be over there.

00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:36.945
- AMICIA: Oh... It stinks...

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.937
- LUCAS: Well...
That means we're on the right path.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:40.953
There it is.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:49.546
Alright, you're ready?

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.477
- AMICIA: Yes. Let's go.

00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:32.172
Urghh...

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:34.966
Rotten flesh...

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.031
- LUCAS: Yes.
It's the butcher's district.

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:40.596
It's the shortest way
to the herbalist.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.967
- MAN 1: Come on, good people!

00:04:43.344 --> 00:04:46.480
I've got all the poultry
that you could ever want.

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:47.754
- MAN 2: Pork pork!

00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:49.359
To roast, to boil!

00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:51.191
Tastiest meat in the world!

00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:54.415
- MAN 3: If you never tried beef,
you don't know what you're missing!

00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:53.461
- AMICIA: Looks tasty for sure.

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:57.348
- LUCAS: There's the city gate.

00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:58.250
- AMICIA: We're not there yet.

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:00.883
And Hugo might even be
getting worse right now.

00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:01.313
Let's hurry!

00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:03.070
- LUCAS: It will be alright.

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:18.390
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.164
- AMICIA: What's this?

00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:21.555
- LUCAS: Nothing good, it seems.

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:25.343 line:20%
- GUARD: This district is now closed
on the authority of the Count Victor of Arles.

00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:28.921 line:20%
For your own safety,
do not try to get inside.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.886 line:20%
- MAN: You can't keep us out!

00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:32.765
- AMICIA: No! Hugo can't wait!

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:35.459
- LUCAS: There might be another way in.

00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.815 line:20%
- MAN: (SHOUTS) Tell us what happened!

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:38.416
- WOMAN 1: My children are in there!

00:05:37.547 --> 00:05:40.214
- WOMAN 2: We know something's going on!

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.005
- MAN: What are you hiding from us?

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:42.977
- WOMAN: Did people die?

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.656
- LUCAS: Hey, there's a back alley
through there.

00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:52.128
What do you think?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500
- AMICIA: Do you see a way in?

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:54.292
- LUCAS: Wait.

00:05:57.422 --> 00:05:58.422
I think...

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.391
Yes...

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:07.289
Through here, Amicia.

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.399
- AMICIA: It looks safe.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.750
- LUCAS: Is it someone's home?

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:15.043
- AMICIA: We're just passing.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.242
Urghh... You must be joking!

00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:20.148
- LUCAS: The butcher's dump!

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.993
We're going in there?

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:27.166
- AMICIA: Don't think.
Just hold your breath.

00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:29.703
No...

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.399
- LUCAS: No no no no no! Urgh!

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:37.031
(COUGHS)

00:06:37.078 --> 00:06:39.145
- AMICIA: Ugh... Don't tell me.

00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:39.821
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:41.910
I've got something in my mouth.

00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:43.689
- AMICIA: I said hold your breath!

00:06:43.094 --> 00:06:44.694
- LUCAS: I panicked!

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:46.379
- AMICIA: Oh Lucas!

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:51.349
- LUCAS: All the living things...
That must be... born from this...

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:54.658
- AMICIA: Why in the world
would you think about that!

00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:55.804
- LUCAS: It stops me from...

00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:57.174
...losing my mind.

00:06:57.078 --> 00:07:00.150
- AMICIA: But it takes me closer to losing mine!

00:06:59.563 --> 00:07:02.163
- LUCAS: Just think of it as matter...

00:07:01.953 --> 00:07:03.553
Being transformed...

00:07:07.438 --> 00:07:08.878
- AMICIA: Oh Lord!

00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:12.215
- LUCAS: My boots are ruined!

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:15.555
- AMICIA: Like the arena.

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:17.645
This whole place is just bait.

00:07:30.109 --> 00:07:31.843
There's a cart in the way.

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:34.024
We have to keep going.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.143
Help me with this.

00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:35.821
- LUCAS: Yes.

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:38.739
- AMICIA: Wait, no!

00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:41.843
(COUGHS)

00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:43.109
What is that?

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:48.937
Oh no! NO!
Not them! Not again!

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.702
- LUCAS: We're going to need fire. Quick!

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:53.069
- AMICIA: I knew it!

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:54.108
They're already spreading.

00:07:53.734 --> 00:07:56.401
Now we'll have to go through them again!

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:59.740
- LUCAS: We can do it.
Just stay focused on getting the nightshade.

00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:00.633
- AMICIA: Yes... Yes.

00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:17.864
(DISTANT SCREAMING)

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.805
- LUCAS: You hear that?

00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:20.324
There're still people around!

00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:23.859
- AMICIA: They didn't evacuate the district!
It's like in the arena.

00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:31.928
- LUCAS: The fire won't be
bright enough to let us cross.

00:08:35.688 --> 00:08:37.368
They came for the meat.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:44.742
- AMICIA: They need to move.

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:47.569
- LUCAS: They want that
hanging carcass, right?

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.590
- AMICIA: Of course, they do.

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:52.746
- LUCAS: They can't reach it.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.031
That bag.

00:08:53.484 --> 00:08:55.484
It's like the one in the cart.

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:57.176
Try hitting it with your sling.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.605
- AMICIA: What's that powder?

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:02.426
- LUCAS: Saltpetre.

00:09:02.656 --> 00:09:06.765
It normally preserves meat
but it's thick enough to choke the flames.

00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.448
- AMICIA: This is more saltpetre, right?

00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:10.484
- LUCAS: Yes. A lot of it.

00:09:10.578 --> 00:09:13.203
- AMICIA: If the people outside
knew what's happening...

00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:15.205
They have family here... Children...

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.822
- LUCAS: There's no way
the army can hide that.

00:09:16.938 --> 00:09:19.071
- AMICIA: Lord... it's infested.

00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:29.895
- LUCAS: Wait, I'm taking some.

00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:31.227
This stuff is too useful.

00:09:31.828 --> 00:09:33.906
Alright. It's all yours now.

00:09:34.078 --> 00:09:36.145
- AMICIA: I have it. Stay back.

00:09:38.859 --> 00:09:39.899
Now the fire.

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:41.156
Yes.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.117
That's it. Let's keep going.

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:51.852
- LUCAS: Yes. Well done.

00:09:56.188 --> 00:09:59.324
I really hope we find our herbalist in this mess.

00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:01.241
- AMICIA: He's outside the city, right?

00:10:00.547 --> 00:10:02.067
So maybe he's safe.

00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:21.044
- LUCAS: Oh no! A soldier!

00:10:20.969 --> 00:10:22.169
- SOLDIER: Hey!

00:10:22.031 --> 00:10:23.711
What are you doing here?

00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:25.313
- AMICIA: We're... just crossing.

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:27.978
- SOLDIER: No one gets out.
Those are the orders.

00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:29.083
- AMICIA: Wait, no!

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.828
- SOLDIER: You should be dead!

00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:31.965
- LUCAS: He's going to throw! Amicia!

00:10:34.547 --> 00:10:35.987
- AMICIA: Oh Lord!

00:10:36.266 --> 00:10:37.706
That was so close.

00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:39.500
- LUCAS: You've just...

00:10:39.547 --> 00:10:42.447
...killed a soldier of the Army of Provence.

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:44.734
- AMICIA: I know!
Why did he attack us?

00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:52.011
- LUCAS: Look!

00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:54.238
They're killing townsfolks.

00:10:54.828 --> 00:10:56.617
- AMICIA: They're purging the districts now.

00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:59.441
- SOLDIER: Hey!
Come back here you bastard!

00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:05.609
Urgh... You won't get further.

00:11:05.953 --> 00:11:08.220
Goddamn biters kill faster than us.

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:10.740
- LUCAS: He'll execute us on sight.

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:13.210
- AMICIA: It's us or them now.
Hugo can't wait.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:14.558
We need that nightshade fast.

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:17.125
- LUCAS: I guess you're right.

00:11:16.797 --> 00:11:17.797
Listen...

00:11:18.188 --> 00:11:20.854
You can use that saltpetre against them.

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:22.985
Take this to craft some Extinguis.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:24.867
It should be enough to put out that torch.

00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:26.891
- AMICIA: Extinguis. Alright.

00:11:29.172 --> 00:11:30.172
Done.

00:11:30.797 --> 00:11:33.197
- LUCAS: Now shoot it to that torch.

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:33.766
You know...

00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:34.766
- AMICIA: I know.

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:42.765
- LUCAS: Goodness...
Well, it... worked.

00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:46.381
- AMICIA: We did it in the past, but...

00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:47.108
...it's still...

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.850
- LUCAS: Disturbing.

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:49.526
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:51.784
I may have to use it again.

00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:54.514
Anyway, thanks.
Get down, another one.

00:12:10.687 --> 00:12:13.087
- LUCAS: I guess they had it coming.

00:12:12.672 --> 00:12:15.872
- AMICIA: No time to cry over them.
Hugo's waiting.

00:12:17.734 --> 00:12:21.894
- SOLDIER: Rememer to mark the houses
you've cleared with a cross.

00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:24.882
It's imperative that the bodies
are taken out of the city.

00:12:24.594 --> 00:12:28.306
- AMICIA: Sure, take the bodies out.
That rats will follow.

00:12:27.406 --> 00:12:29.740
- LUCAS: How can they be so stupid!

00:12:50.609 --> 00:12:54.385
- AMICIA: We must leave this city.
Leave this Vaudin behind.

00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:55.765
- LUCAS: For what, Amicia?

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.321
A dream of an island?

00:12:57.203 --> 00:13:00.103
- AMICIA: A dream
he's been having for weeks.

00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:31.258
That's the city gate.

00:13:30.938 --> 00:13:32.298
- LUCAS: At last.

00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:35.815 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Remeber, men.
Stay in the light at all cost!

00:13:35.844 --> 00:13:38.244
- LUCAS: Oh no, they're heading out.

00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:39.999
Our herbalist's out there.

00:13:39.703 --> 00:13:44.119
- AMICIA: Don't tell me
they're also purging the outskirts! Goddammit!

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:47.023
- LUCAS: Hey... Hey...
We can still reach him before them.

00:13:47.047 --> 00:13:48.727
- AMICIA: It never ends.

00:14:01.172 --> 00:14:04.515
A tool. I could improve my gear
if I found a workbench.

00:14:11.031 --> 00:14:12.471
- LUCAS: Soldiers.

00:14:21.063 --> 00:14:22.743
- AMICIA: Two torches.

00:14:22.234 --> 00:14:23.796
- LUCAS: Your jar.

00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:26.511
A cloud of Extinguis
will put out several torches.

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:28.199
- AMICIA: A jar of Extinguis?

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.030
That could work.

00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:41.192
- LUCAS: Let's say it's useful.

00:14:40.719 --> 00:14:44.367
- AMICIA: They've wasted
enough of our time already. Come.

00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:46.166
- LUCAS: They closed the portcullis.

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:48.367
- AMICIA: There must be a way
to open it again.

00:15:05.859 --> 00:15:07.539
I hope Hugo's holding on.

00:15:07.609 --> 00:15:09.476
- LUCAS: I hate to say it...

00:15:09.063 --> 00:15:10.743
But he's survived worse.

00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:12.331
- AMICIA: This has to stop.

00:15:18.219 --> 00:15:20.219
We're going to have a problem.

00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:20.776
- LUCAS: What?

00:15:20.813 --> 00:15:24.781
- AMICIA: There's no brake on this thing.
So we'll have to run.

00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:27.753
That's it.
Release on my go.

00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:30.063
Now! Go!

00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:31.702
- LUCAS: Coming.

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.499
- AMICIA: Come on! Faster!

00:15:35.313 --> 00:15:37.313
- LUCAS: I'm right behind you!

00:15:41.234 --> 00:15:43.434
- AMICIA: (SIGHS OF RELIEF)
Yes...

00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:45.899
- LUCAS: We're here...

00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:46.781
Good work.

00:15:49.422 --> 00:15:50.622
- AMICIA: Look.

00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:51.938
No rats.

00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:54.936
- LUCAS: So it stopped at the city walls.

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:57.069
- AMICIA: (SCOFFS)
They don't care about walls.

00:15:56.203 --> 00:15:57.883
They care about food.

00:15:57.594 --> 00:16:00.327
- LUCAS: I don't see any soldiers either.

00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:02.155
- AMICIA: Hey...

00:16:02.516 --> 00:16:04.196
I've just remembered.

00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:06.149
In Vaudin's laboratory...

00:16:06.188 --> 00:16:09.054
Th-there was a fresco
with an island on it.

00:16:09.078 --> 00:16:10.358
I saw it, Lucas!

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.775
What about that?
Vaudin must know about it.

00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:15.742
- LUCAS: Alright, alright...

00:16:15.563 --> 00:16:16.563
I'll...

00:16:16.406 --> 00:16:17.526
...try to ask.

00:16:17.594 --> 00:16:19.194
- AMICIA: Thank you.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:24.859
Now... Mother said the herbalist lives
at the edge of the forest. We should be close.

00:16:24.703 --> 00:16:26.383
- LUCAS: It's so quiet.

00:16:25.922 --> 00:16:27.602
- AMICIA: It feels off.

00:16:28.063 --> 00:16:30.663
There were people here
not too long ago.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.903
Someone used that forge recently.

00:16:37.531 --> 00:16:40.198
- LUCAS: Hey...
There's a workbench here.

00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:42.157
You can improve your gear with it.

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.668
Just take a look right now...

00:16:43.344 --> 00:16:45.277
We don't know what awaits us.

00:16:44.688 --> 00:16:46.368
- AMICIA: You're right.

00:16:55.922 --> 00:16:57.722
That's better.
That'll help.

00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:00.890
- LUCAS: We're good to go?

00:17:00.234 --> 00:17:01.914
- AMICIA: Yes. Let's go.

00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:03.570
Urgh... There's a body here.

00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:05.299
- LUCAS: The rats?

00:17:04.938 --> 00:17:05.978
- AMICIA: No.

00:17:07.188 --> 00:17:08.188
Stabbed.

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:10.268
Probably soldiers.

00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:24.296
- LUCAS: Come on.
They're here. They're here too.

00:17:24.828 --> 00:17:27.695
- AMICIA: I told you.
No wall can stop them.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.797
- LUCAS: It's those carcasses.

00:17:29.703 --> 00:17:30.823
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:17:30.609 --> 00:17:32.609
They keep following the blood.

00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:35.795
- LUCAS: But we...
don't know where the blood stops.
