- HUGO: You sunk so many!

00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:27.626
You're a great captain.

00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.999
And Tonin was nice!
- AMICIA: He was, yes.

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:43.999
- HUGO: I'd like to have a friend like him.
- AMICIA: I know.

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:46.999
But we'll settle down soon.
And you'll make friends.

00:10:46.999 --> 00:10:47.999
- HUGO: You sure?

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:49.792
- AMICIA: As soon as we know
how you're doing.

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:50.918
- HUGO: Hm..

00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:52.999
That could be a long time!

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:53.999
- AMICIA: Not this time.

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:55.999
This time is different. I know it.

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:57.417
- HUGO: I hope so.

00:10:58.667 --> 00:11:00.999
- AMICIA: Hmm... We have to climb this.

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:02.209
You pull me up this time.

00:11:02.334 --> 00:11:02.999
- HUGO: What?

00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:05.250
- AMICIA: Just kidding. I'll help you.

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:06.999
- HUGO: You're too heavy anyway.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.999
- AMICIA: (SCOFFS) How dare you!

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:11.918

00:11:24.999 --> 00:11:27.999
Wow! That castle is huge!

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:29.999
- AMICIA: What do you say?
Do we attack it?

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:31.999
- HUGO: Alright. I'm ready!

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:33.999

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:44.999
(PANTING)

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.999
The gate is closed, captain.
What do we do?

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.999
- AMICIA: Let's me see.

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:00.999
Ha! It's locked up tight.

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:04.125
- HUGO: They saw us coming!
Here, secret path!

00:12:04.292 --> 00:12:05.959
- AMICIA: Let's sneak in!

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:07.999
- HUGO: Yes, it's a good plan!

00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:10.999
- AMICIA: Oohh... I feel evil around us!

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:13.500
- HUGO: Hm... It's a bit... dark...

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:16.999
- AMICIA: Come on, my King.
They don't expect us to sneak in.

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:17.999
- HUGO: Yes.

00:12:23.999 --> 00:12:26.999
- AMICIA: Oh... I think
the sorcerer's men are close.

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:27.999
- HUGO: Really?

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:31.751

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:35.999
- HUGO: No... But... I want to go back now.

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:36.999
- AMICIA: I agree.

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:40.375
That's enough for today.
- HUGO: Yes. Amicia...

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:42.292
There are food and clothes.

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:43.500
- AMICIA: People live here.

00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:45.167
- HUGO: We've broken their ceiling.

00:12:45.334 --> 00:12:47.999
Maybe they heard.
- AMICIA: Let's...

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:49.959
Just... be careful for now.

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:52.999
- HUGO: Do you smell that?

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:55.999
It smells like a fireplace.
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:08.999
What?

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:10.751
- HUGO: It's all burnt.

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:12.042
- AMICIA: It's recent.

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:13.999
These baskets...

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:15.667
Their beehives...

00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:18.876
- HUGO: But... why... are they burnt?

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:19.999
- AMICIA: I don't know.

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:21.999
Let's be discreet and get out.

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.999
- HUGO: Maybe it was an accident?

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:36.999
- AMICIA: Where are the people?

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:41.999
This way.

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:50.999
