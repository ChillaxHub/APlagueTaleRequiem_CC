They're the smartest people I know.

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:08.206
- HUGO: It's bleeding again.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:12.776
- AMICIA: Yes, we should fix that
before it gets infected I guess.

- HUGO: Yes.

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:43.722
These look like teeth.

00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:45.644
It's a two teeth island.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:47.838
- AMICIA: You know...

00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:49.078

On a painting...

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.910
In Vaudin's laboratory.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.299

- AMICIA: By boat.

00:03:06.323 --> 00:03:08.003
Once we know where it is.

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:10.026
- HUGO: Do you think Mummy will be angry?

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:11.432
- AMICIA: She won't be pleased, but...

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.245
Don't worry.

- HUGO: Hm... And...

00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:16.312
Do you think
those bandits will follow them?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.224
- AMICIA: No... they'll be safe.

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.166
- HUGO: But... they have no weapons.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:22.397

- HUGO: Hm...

00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:26.218

from that nest up in the tree, see?

00:04:40.504 --> 00:04:42.104
- HUGO: Oh... yes...

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:45.216

I found some pretty flowers
when I was out with Lucas.

Do you want them?

00:04:58.408 --> 00:05:00.948

00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:21.974
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:25.104
- PERREUX: What's going on?

00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:27.088
- SOLDIER: We're looking for a boy and a girl.

00:10:26.651 --> 00:10:28.963
The girl has killed several soldiers.

00:10:28.683 --> 00:10:30.416
She's armed and dangerous.

00:10:30.433 --> 00:10:32.699
By order of Count Victor of Arles.

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.510
We're searching this camp.

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:37.401
- PERREUX: I know a guilty look when I see one.

00:10:37.448 --> 00:10:39.495
But... whatever you've done.

00:10:40.464 --> 00:10:42.197
I won't give up a child.

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:45.832
Come with me.

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:57.000
We need to get you out of the camp.

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:58.326
Follow me closely.

00:10:58.729 --> 00:11:00.009
Try to blend in.

00:10:59.729 --> 00:11:01.409
- WOMAN 1: What's going on?

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:03.306
- SOLDIER: Make way. Clear your tents.

00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:05.385
- WOMAN 2: They're looking for someone.

00:11:04.558 --> 00:11:07.566
- SOLDIER: Cooperate, and no harm will be done.

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:09.288
- MAN 1: Please, don't hurt us.

00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:11.481
- MAN 2: We haven't done anything.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:12.338
We're good Christians.

00:11:12.412 --> 00:11:15.063
- THE BEAST: Any new pilgrim recently?
Interloeprs?

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:14.687
- PERREUX: Careful.

00:11:15.147 --> 00:11:18.389
- WOMAN: (SCOFFS) There're new people
coming everyday, you know.

00:11:18.183 --> 00:11:19.976
- HUGO: Will people tell on us?

00:11:19.707 --> 00:11:21.387
- PERREUX: No, but...

00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:22.869
I hope you'll make amends.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:24.704
- AMICIA: I'm trying.

00:11:24.323 --> 00:11:26.990
- PERREUX: We're all judged, eventually.

00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:31.955
Slowly, there're more of them.

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:35.166
- SOLDIER 1: Two children.
A girl and a small boy.

00:11:35.292 --> 00:11:38.291
- MAN: I'm not sure.
There-there're so many of us now.

00:11:37.729 --> 00:11:39.409
- SOLDIER 1: Then, think.

00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:41.620
- WOMAN: Hey! Be careful!

00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:43.363
- SOLDIER 2: Stay back!

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:46.756
- PERREUX: No.

00:11:46.151 --> 00:11:47.591
- AMICIA: Problem.

00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:49.338
- PERREUX: Hide under that cart
before they see you.

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:50.746
I'll handle them.

00:11:53.115 --> 00:11:54.305
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:54.972
- HUGO: Amicia...

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:56.194
- AMICIA: I know, shh...

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.019
- PERREUX: Excuse me.

00:11:56.702 --> 00:11:58.228
- SOLDIER 1: What do you want?

00:11:57.879 --> 00:12:00.148
- PERREUX: Have you checked
that group over there?

00:12:00.212 --> 00:12:02.151
Some of them joined us recently.

00:12:02.057 --> 00:12:04.637
Not that they really look like
your fugitives, but...

00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:05.709
...who knows.

00:12:05.632 --> 00:12:08.236
- SOLDIER 1: It's better than nothing.
Let's go and see.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.724
- SOLDIER 2: You heard him.
Be on guard and keep your eyes open.

00:12:11.577 --> 00:12:12.888
- AMICIA: Good idea!

00:12:12.555 --> 00:12:14.174
- HUGO: Do we go now, Amicia?

00:12:13.904 --> 00:12:15.793
- AMICIA: Not yet.
Wait for his signal.

00:12:15.523 --> 00:12:16.659
- HUGO: Mm hm...

00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:17.786
- SOLDIER: Ey, you!

00:12:17.993 --> 00:12:18.993
- WOMAN: Me?

00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:20.599
- SOLDIER: How long
have you been with this procession?

00:12:20.136 --> 00:12:22.958
- PERREUX: The way is clear.
Come. Calmly.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.562
- AMICIA: Let's go.

00:12:26.464 --> 00:12:28.338
- PERREUX: You'll find a path to the sea.

00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:29.835
On the other side of this pen.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.401
- AMICIA: We won't forget this.

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:32.263
- HUGO: Thank you!

00:12:31.854 --> 00:12:33.534
- PERREUX: Be careful.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.182
- AMICIA: Come on.
We need to get away from here.

00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:38.901
- HUGO: I hope this all just won't happen.

00:12:38.776 --> 00:12:41.088
- AMICIA: They won't hurt anybody
if they don't find us.

00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:43.215
Let's get as far away as possible.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.166
- SOLDIER: Some people just saw a boy
and a girl crossing the camp.

00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:52.916
Extend the search!

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.256
- HUGO: Oh no!

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.353
- AMICIA: Quick!

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.877
- SOLDIER: Stop! Here!
They're here!

00:12:57.901 --> 00:12:59.581
Run, Hugo! Straight on!

00:13:02.675 --> 00:13:04.491
- AMICIA: Take... your hands...

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.034
...off me!

00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:08.553
Oh no! Hugo!

00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:14.087
- SOLDIER: On me! They're here!
I need reinforcements!

00:13:14.237 --> 00:13:15.437
- HUGO: Amicia!

00:13:14.823 --> 00:13:17.108
- AMICIA: (GROANS) My head.

00:13:16.073 --> 00:13:18.397
- HUGO: Get up! We must leave!

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.467
- AMICIA: Yes... Yes...

00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:22.791
I'm dizzy.

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:24.437
Your hand.

00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:27.331
- HUGO: You're bleeding again.

00:13:27.597 --> 00:13:28.957
- AMICIA: Lord...

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.104
- SOLDIER: After them!

00:13:32.128 --> 00:13:33.328
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:37.459
We must leave!

00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:39.615
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:42.342
We have to keep... moving.

00:13:44.022 --> 00:13:45.487
- HUGO: Where are we?

00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:47.479
- AMICIA: Looks like... a quarry.

00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:51.131
- HUGO: We're going in there? It's dark.

00:13:51.378 --> 00:13:55.897
- AMICIA: (GROANS) I don't...
know if there's another way.

00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:00.116
Let's push inside.

00:14:00.253 --> 00:14:02.948
We must not stay in the open.

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:11.346
We'll make it.
Now we know where the sea is.

00:14:11.444 --> 00:14:14.217
- HUGO: It doesn't matter.
I want you to be safe.

00:14:14.003 --> 00:14:15.123
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:14:15.214 --> 00:14:17.791
I'm... working on it.

00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:31.659
- HUGO: Where are they?

00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:34.725
- AMICIA: Don't know.
Hold my hand tight.

00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:36.483
- HUGO: Did you really kill soldiers?

00:14:36.054 --> 00:14:38.807
- AMICIA: Yes... I-I-I lost myself.

00:14:38.866 --> 00:14:40.666
- HUGO: You didn't tell me!

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.070
- AMICIA: I was ashamed.

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:43.514
Now stay focused.

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:46.464
Take care of it, Hugo.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.190
- HUGO: Yes.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.550
It's open.

00:14:54.385 --> 00:14:55.985
- AMICIA: Well done.

00:14:57.507 --> 00:14:59.792
- HUGO: Are they the soldiers from the city?

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:00.452
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:02.683
- HUGO: But... they were nice.

00:15:02.413 --> 00:15:05.805
- AMICIA: They looked nice.
They were not. Believe me.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.580
Let's see what's inside.

00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:44.200
- HUGO: Amicia, your head...

00:15:44.127 --> 00:15:46.727
- AMICIA: I know.
But we can't stop now.

00:15:46.794 --> 00:15:48.474
Don't worry about me.

00:15:47.984 --> 00:15:49.264
- HUGO: Mm hm...

00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:02.893
Stop, Amicia.

00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:04.873
There're people.

00:16:04.532 --> 00:16:06.865
- AMICIA: I hear nothing.
How'd you know?

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:09.341
- HUGO: I... I feel them.

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.199
I think it's the rats.

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:14.308
I can try to feel better.

00:16:14.914 --> 00:16:16.660
- AMICIA: You sure about this?

00:16:16.248 --> 00:16:17.928
- HUGO: Yes. Don't worry.

00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:20.462
- AMICIA: Fine... careful.

00:16:23.194 --> 00:16:27.593
- HUGO: Yes, I see them.
They're here. Soldiers.

00:16:27.896 --> 00:16:29.576
- AMICIA: Hold on... How?

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:33.028
- HUGO: The rats...
They can feel people's blood.

00:16:33.606 --> 00:16:34.844
Now I can too.

00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:36.889
It's like a noise...

00:16:37.498 --> 00:16:38.609
Like an echo.

00:16:38.657 --> 00:16:40.221
- AMICIA: So where are they?

00:16:39.777 --> 00:16:43.421
- HUGO: Close. Coming.
I can do it again if you want.

00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:45.713
- AMICIA: Good. Let's go. Careful.

00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:39.391
A door. Up there.

00:18:40.684 --> 00:18:42.551
- HUGO: Your head looks bad.

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:47.703
- AMICIA: I'm fine. The rats, Hugo...
Are they a threat? Are they coming out?

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:50.089
- HUGO: No, they're deep for now.

00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:52.252
- AMICIA: Stay focused on them.

00:18:55.056 --> 00:18:56.531
- HUGO: I see more of them.

00:18:56.246 --> 00:18:58.113
- AMICIA: You're doing well.

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.287
- HUGO: They're here too.

00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:05.593
- AMICIA: How do we get out of here?

00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:09.126
Go to hell.

00:20:10.796 --> 00:20:12.970
- HUGO: What are you doing, Amicia?

00:20:58.092 --> 00:20:59.692
Here. The trap door.

00:20:59.954 --> 00:21:02.221
- AMICIA: Yes, that's our way out.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.884
(GROANS) Not now...

00:21:10.783 --> 00:21:12.143
- HUGO: Amicia...

00:21:12.316 --> 00:21:15.093
- AMICIA: (EXHALES DEEPLY)
Let me... breathe...

00:21:14.237 --> 00:21:16.304
- HUGO: We should wait, Amicia.

00:21:15.913 --> 00:21:17.913
- AMICIA: No, they'll find us.

00:21:17.739 --> 00:21:19.806
We have to reach that building.

00:21:19.518 --> 00:21:21.198
- HUGO: Is it a church?

00:21:21.512 --> 00:21:23.957
- AMICIA: Don't know.
But we're too exposed.

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.912
We'll try in there.
Maybe safer.

00:21:26.445 --> 00:21:28.841
- SOLDIER: ...Search the area.
Get that witch!

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:30.467
- HUGO: They won't give up.

00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:32.478
- AMICIA: They're butchers.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.768
- HUGO: Did you kill a lot of them
in the city?

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:36.892
- AMICIA: More than I should have.

00:22:04.337 --> 00:22:09.210
- SOLDIER 1: Remember, the Count of Arles
wants this land cleaned of its scum!

00:22:09.305 --> 00:22:11.363
This girl killed yo brothers.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.824
Our execution will take place here!

00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:16.075
- SOLDIER 2: And where is our Count, huh?

00:22:15.886 --> 00:22:18.152
His land is stripping by a plague.

00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:22.055
- SOLDIER 1: He's the one
giving the orders. Show some respect!

00:23:10.191 --> 00:23:12.873
- AMICIA: We can...
We can make it...

00:23:14.138 --> 00:23:15.258
- HUGO: Yes...

00:23:14.534 --> 00:23:15.814
- AMICIA: Quiet.

00:24:23.163 --> 00:24:25.497
- HUGO: We're almost there, Amicia.

00:24:26.644 --> 00:24:27.764
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:24:44.915 --> 00:24:46.648
Be cautious with the drop.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.830
- HUGO: I'll try.

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:26.022
- AMICIA: Up, there.

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:27.164
- HUGO: On my way.

00:25:48.462 --> 00:25:49.462
The rats...

00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:50.589
I feel them...

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.520
...moving below.

00:25:52.853 --> 00:25:54.533
They're following us.

00:25:55.667 --> 00:25:57.962
- AMICIA: Leave them are for now.

00:26:18.888 --> 00:26:19.888
Clear.

00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:23.069
- HUGO: Be careful.
You're too tired.

00:26:24.045 --> 00:26:25.845
- AMICIA: Don't... worry...

00:28:26.343 --> 00:28:28.469
(EXHALES) We're here.

00:28:28.264 --> 00:28:31.821
But... I'm sorry, I'm not good, Hugo.

00:28:31.662 --> 00:28:33.462
- HUGO: You'll rest inside.

00:28:43.604 --> 00:28:47.081
- AMICIA: We're... (GROANS)

00:28:47.657 --> 00:28:54.110
(BREATHES HEAVILY) It hurts... so much...
I'm not sure I'll make it.

00:28:54.133 --> 00:28:56.323
- HUGO: No, it will go away.

00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:58.071
I'll protect you.
